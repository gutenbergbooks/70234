  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER I.<br> <span class='large'>SPRING BANK.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>It was a large, old-fashioned, wooden building, with
long, winding piazzas, and low, square porches, where the
summer sunshine held many a fantastic dance, and where
the winter storm piled up its drifts of snow, whistling
merrily as it worked, and shaking the loosened casement,
as it went whirling by. In front was a wide-spreading
grassy lawn with the carriage road winding through
it, over the running brook and onward beneath tall forest
trees until it reached the main highway, a distance of
nearly half a mile. In the rear was a spacious garden,
with bordered walks, climbing roses and creeping vines
showing that some where there was a ruling hand, which,
while neglecting the sombre building and suffering it to
decay, lavished due care upon the grounds, and not on
these alone, but also on the well kept barns, and the
white-washed dwellings of the negroes,—for ours is a Kentucky
scene, and Spring Bank a Kentucky home.</p>

<p class='c011'>As we have described it so it was on a drear December
night, when a fearful storm, for that latitude, was raging,
and the snow lay heaped against the fences, or sweeping
down from the bending trees, drifted against the doors,
and beat against the windows, whence a cheerful light
was gleaming, telling of life and possible happiness within.
There were no flowing curtains before the windows,
no drapery sweeping to the floor—nothing save blinds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>without and simple shades within, neither of which were
doing service now, for the master of the house would
have it so in spite of his sister’s remonstrances.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Some one might lose their way on that terrible night,”
he said, “and the blaze of the fire on the hearth, which
could be seen from afar, would be to them a beacon light
to guide them on their way. Nobody would look in upon
them, as Adaline, or ’Lina as she chose to be called
seemed to think there might, and even if they did, why
need she care? She was looking well enough, and she’d
undone all those little braids which disfigured her so
shockingly in the morning, but which, when brushed and
carefully arranged, gave her hair that waving appearance
she so much desired. As for himself, he never meant to
do anything of which he was ashamed, so he did not care
how many were watching him through the window,” and
stamping his heavy boots upon the rug, for he had just
come in from the storm, Hugh Worthington piled fresh
fuel upon the fire, and shaking back the mass of short
brown curls which had fallen upon his forehead, strode
across the room and arranged the shades to his liking,
then, sitting down before the fire, he went off into a reverie,
the nature of which his mother, who was watching
him, could not guess; and when at last she asked of what
he was thinking so intently, he made her no reply. He
could hardly have told himself, so varied were the
thoughts crowding upon his brain that wintry night.
Now they were of the eccentric old man, from whom he
had received Spring Bank, together with the many peculiar
ideas which made him the strange, odd creature he was,
a mystery to his own sex, and a kind of terror to the female
portion of the neighborhood, who, looking upon him as a
woman-hater, avoided or coveted his society, just as their
fancy dictated. For years the old man and the boy had
lived alone in that great house, enjoying the freedom from
all restraint, the liberty of turning the parlors into kennels
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>if they chose, and converting the upper rooms into a
hay-loft, if they would. No white woman was ever seen
upon the premises, unless she came as a beggar, when some
new gown, or surplice, or organ, or chandelier, was needed
for the pretty little church, lifting its modest spire so unobtrusively
among the forest trees, not very far from Spring
Bank. John Stanley didn’t believe in churches, nor gowns
nor organs, nor women, but he was proverbially liberal
and so the fair ones of Glen’s Creek neighborhood ventured
into his den, finding it much pleasanter to do so after
the handsome, dark-haired boy came to live with him
for about Hugh there was then something very attractive
to the little girls, while their mothers pitied him, wondering
why he had been permitted to come there, and
watching for the change in him, which was sure to ensue.</p>

<p class='c011'>Not all at once did Hugh conform to the customs of
his uncle’s household, and at first there often came over
him a longing for the refinements of his Northern home,
and a wish to infuse into Chloe, the colored housekeeper,
some of his mother’s neatness. But a few attempts at reform
had taught him how futile was the effort, Aunt Chloe
always meeting him with the argument,</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tain’t no use, Mas’r Hugh. A nigger’s a nigger;
and I spec’ ef you’re to talk to me till you was hoarse
bout your Yankee ways of scrubbin’, and sweepin’, and
moppin’ with a broom, I shouldn’t be an atomer white-folksey
than I is now. Besides Mas’r John wouldn’t bar
no finery; he’s only happy when the truck is mighty
nigh a foot thick, and his things is lyin’ round loose and
handy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>To a certain extent this was true, for John Stanley would
have felt sadly out of place in any spot where, as Chloe
said, “his things were not lying round loose and handy,”
and as habit is everything, so Hugh soon grew accustomed
to his surroundings, and became as careless of his
external appearance as his uncle could desire. Only once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>had there come to him an awakening—a faint conception
of the happiness there might arise from constant association
with the pure and refined, such as his uncle had
labored to make him believe did not exist. He was
thinking of that incident now, and it was not strange that
he did not heed his mother when she spoke, for Hugh was
far away from Spring Bank, and the storm beating against
its walls was to him like the sound of the waves dashing
against the vessel’s side, just as they did years ago on
that night he remembered so well, shuddering as he heard
again the murderous hiss of the devouring flames, covering
the fated boat with one sheet of fire, and driving into
the water as a safer friend the shrieking, frightened
wretches who but an hour before had been so full of life
and hope, dancing gayly above the red-tongued demon
stealthily creeping upward from the hold below, where it
had taken life. What a fearful scene that was, and the
veins grew larger on Hugh’s brow while his broad chest
heaved with something like a stifled sob as he recalled
the little childish form to which he had clung so madly
until the cruel timber struck from him all consciousness,
and he let that form go down—‘neath the treacherous
waters of Lake Erie never to come up again alive, for so
his uncle told him when, weeks after the occurrence, he
awoke from the delirious fever which ensued and listened
to the sickening detail.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lost, my boy, lost with many others,” was what his
uncle had said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Lost</em>”—there was a world of meaning in that word
to Hugh and though it was but a child he lost, yet in the
quiet night, when all else around Spring Bank was locked
in sleep, he often lay thinking of her and of what he
might perhaps have been had she been spared to him.
He had talked with her scarcely an hour in all, but even
in that time she had made upon him an impression
which could never be effaced. He was thinking of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>now, and as he thought, visions of a sweet, young face,
shadowed with curls of golden hair, came up before his
mind, and he saw again the look of surprise and pain
which shone in the soft, blue eyes and illuminated every
feature when in answer to some remark of hers he gave
vent to the half infidel principles he had learned from his
uncle. Her creed was different from his, and she explained
it to him so earnestly, that he said to her at last
he did but jest to hear what she would say, and though
she seemed satisfied he felt there was a shadow between
them which was not swept away, even after he promised
to read the Bible she timidly offered him and which he
had accepted wondering at her interest in one whose <em>name</em>
she did not even know. <em>Hers</em> was written on the fly-leaf
of the little book which he had yet hidden away where
no curious eye could find it, while carefully folded between
its leaves was a curl of golden hair. That tress and the
Bible which enclosed it had made Hugh Worthington a
better man. He did not often read the Bible, it is true,
and his acquaintances were frequently startled with opinions
which had so pained the little girl on board the St.
Helena, but this was merely on the surface, for far below
the rough exterior there was a world of goodness, a mine
of gems kept bright by memories of the angel child who
flitted for so brief a span across his pathway and then
was lost forever. He had tried so hard to save her—had
clasped her so fondly to his bosom when with extended
arms she came to him for aid. He could save her,
he said—he could swim to the shore with perfect ease;
and so without a moment’s hesitation she had leaped
with him into the surging waves, and that was about the
last he could remember, save that he clutched frantically
at the long, golden hair streaming above the water, retaining
in his grasp the lock which no one at Spring
Bank had ever seen, for this one romance of Hugh’s life
was a secret with himself. No one save his uncle had
witnessed his emotions when told that she was dead; no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>one else had seen his bitter tears or heard the vehement
exclamation, “You’ve tried to teach me there was no
hereafter, no Heaven for such as she, but I know better
now, and I am glad there is, for she is safe forever.”</p>

<p class='c011'>These were not idle words, and the belief then expressed
became with Hugh Worthington a fixed principle,
which his skeptical uncle tried in vain to eradicate.
“There was a Heaven, and she was there,” comprised
nearly the whole of Hugh’s religious creed, if we except
a vague, misty hope, that he, too, would some day find
her, how or by what means he never seriously inquired;
only this he knew, it would be through her influence,
which even now followed him every where, producing its
good effects. It had checked him many and many a time
when his fierce temper was in the ascendant, forcing back
the harsh words he would otherwise have spoken, and making
him as gentle as a child; and when the temptations
to which young men of his age are exposed were spread
out alluringly before him, a single thought of her was
sufficient to lead him from the forbidden ground.</p>

<p class='c011'>Every incident connected with his brief acquaintance
with Golden Hair seemed to be recalled to his mind this
wintry night, and so absorbed was he in his reverie that
until twice repeated he did not hear his mother’s anxious
inquiry,</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is that noise? It sounds like some one in distress.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hugh started at last, and after listening for a moment
he, too, caught the sound which had alarmed his mother,
and made ’Lina stop her reading. A moaning cry, as if
for help, mingled with an infant’s wail, now here, now
there it seemed to be, just as the fierce north wind shifted
its course and drove first at the window of the sitting-room, and then at the ponderous doors of the gloomy
hall.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is some one in the storm,” Hugh said, going to the
window and peering out into the darkness.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>“Lyd’s child, most likely. Negro young ones are
always squalling, and I heard her tell Aunt Chloe at supper
time that Tommie had the colic,” ’Lina remarked,
opening again the book she was reading, and with a
slight shiver drawing nearer to the fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where are you going, my son?” asked Mrs. Worthington,
as Hugh arose to leave the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Going to Lyd’s cabin, for if Tommie is sick enough to
make his screams heard above the storm, she may need
some help,” was Hugh’s reply, and a moment after he
was ploughing his way through the drifts which lay between
the house and the negro quarters.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How kind and thoughtful he is,” the mother said,
more to herself than to her daughter, who nevertheless
quickly rejoined,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, kind to niggers, and horses, and dogs, I’ll admit,
but let me, or any other white woman come before him as
an object of pity, and the tables are turned at once. I
wonder what does make him hate women so.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t believe he does,” Mrs. Worthington replied.
“His uncle, you know, was very unfortunate in his marriage,
and had a way of judging all our sex by his wife.
Living with him as long as Hugh did, it’s natural he should
imbibe a few of his ideas.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A few,” ’Lina repeated, “better say all, for John Stanley
and Hugh Worthington are as near alike as an old and
young man well could be. What an old codger he was,
and how like a savage he lived here. I never shall forget
how the house looked the day we came, or how satisfied
Hugh seemed when he met us at the gate, and said, ‘everything
was in splendid order,’” and closing her book, the
young lady laughed merrily as she recalled the time when
she first crossed her brother’s threshold, stepping, as she
affirmed, over half a dozen dogs, and as many squirming
kittens, catching her foot in some fishing tackle, finding
tobacco in the china closet, and segars in the knife box,
where they had been put to get them out of the way.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>“But Hugh really did his best for us,” mildly interposed
the mother. “Don’t you remember what the servants
said about his cleaning one floor himself because he knew
they were tired!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did it more to save the lazy negroes’ steps than from
any regard for our comfort,” retorted ’Lina. “At all
events he’s been mighty careful since, how he gratified
my wishes. Sometimes I believe he perfectly hates me,
and wishes I’d never been born,” and tears which arose
from anger, rather than any wounded sisterly feeling,
glittered in ’Lina’s black eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hugh does not hate any one,” said Mrs. Worthington,
“much less his sister, though you must admit that you try
him terribly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How, I’d like to know?” ’Lina asked, and her mother
replied,</p>

<p class='c011'>“He thinks you proud, and vain, and artificial, and
you know he abhors deceit above all else. Why he’d
cut off his right hand sooner than tell a lie.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pshaw!” was ’Lina’s contemptuous response, then
after a moment, she continued, “I wonder how we came
to be so different. He must be like his father, and I like
mine, that is, supposing I know who he is. Wouldn’t it
be funny if, just to be hateful, he had sent you back the
wrong child!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What made you think of that?” Mrs. Worthington
asked, quickly, and ’Lina replied,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, nothing, only the last time Hugh had one of his
tantrums, and got so outrageously angry at me, he said
he’d give all he owned if it were so, but I reckon he’ll
never have his wish. There’s too much of old Sam about
me to admit of a doubt,” and, laughing spitefully, ’Lina returned
to her book, just as Hugh re-entered the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you heard that sound again?” he asked. “It
wasn’t Tommie, for I found him asleep, and I’ve been all
round the house, but could discover nothing. The storm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>is beginning to abate, I think, and the moon is trying to
break through the clouds,” and going again to the window,
Hugh looked out into the yard, where the shrubbery
and trees were just discernible in the greyish light of
the December moon. “That’s a big drift by the lower
gate,” he continued “and queer shaped, too. Come see,
mother. Isn’t that a shawl, or an apron, or something
blowing in the wind?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Worthington arose, and joining her son, looked in
the direction indicated, where a garment of some kind
was certainly fluttering in the gale.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s something from the wash, I guess,” she said. “I
thought all the time Hannah had better not hang out the
clothes, as some of them were sure to be lost.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This explanation was quite satisfactory to Mrs. Worthington,
but that strange drift by the gate troubled Hugh,
and the signal above it seemed to him like a signal of distress.
Why should the snow drift there more than elsewhere?
He never knew it do so before. He had half
a mind to turn out the dogs, and see what that would do.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rover,” he called suddenly, as he advanced to the
rear room, where, among his other pets, was a huge Newfoundland,
of great sagacity. “Rover, Rover, I want
you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In an instant the whole pack were upon him, jumping
and fawning, and licking the hands which had never
dealt them aught save kindness. It was only Rover,
however, who was this time needed, and leading him to
the door, Hugh pointed toward the gate, and bade him
see what was there. Snuffing slightly at the storm which
was not over yet, Rover started down the walk, while
Hugh stood waiting in the door. At first Rover’s steps
were slow and uncertain, but as he advanced they increased
in rapidity, until, with a sudden bound and a cry,
such as dogs are wont to give when they have caught
their destined prey, he sprang upon the mysterious ridge,
and commenced digging it down with his paws.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>“Easy, Rover—be careful,” Hugh called from the
door, and instantly the half savage growl which the wind
had brought to his ear was changed into a piteous cry, as
if the faithful creature were answering back that other
help than his was needed there.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rover had found something in that pile of snow.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER II.<br> <span class='large'>WHAT ROVER FOUND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Unmindful of the sleet beating upon his uncovered head,
Hugh hastened to the spot, where the noble brute was
licking a baby face, which he had ferreted out from beneath
the shawl wrapped so carefully around it to shield
it from the cold, for instead of <em>one</em> there were <em>two</em> in that
drift of snow—a mother and her child! Dead the former
seemed, for the white cheek which Hugh touched was
cold as stone, and with a sickening feeling the young man
leaned against the gate-post and tried to assure himself
that what he saw was a mere fancy of the brain. But it
was terribly real. That stiffened form lying there so still
hugging that sleeping child so closely to its bosom, was
no delusion, and his mother’s voice, calling to know what
he was doing, brought Hugh back at last to a consciousness
that he must act immediately.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mother,” he screamed, “send a servant here, quick,
or let Ad come herself. There’s a woman dead, I fear. I
can carry her well enough, but Ad must come for the
child.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The what?” gasped Mrs. Worthington, who, terrified
beyond measure at the mention of a dead woman, was
doubly so at hearing of a child. “A child,” she repeated,
“whose child?” while ’Lina, shrinking back from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>keen blast, refused to obey, and so the mother, throwing
her cloak around her, joined the group by the gate.</p>

<p class='c011'>Carefully Hugh lifted the light figure in his arms and
bore it to the house, where ’Lina, whose curiosity had overcome
her selfishness, met him on the piazza and led the
way to the sitting-room, asking innumerable questions as
to how he found her and who she was.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hugh made no reply save an order that the lounge
should be brought near the fire and a pillow from his
mother’s bed. “From mine, then,” he added, as he saw
the anxious look in his mother’s face, and guessed that
she shrank from having her own snowy pillow come in
contact with the wet, limpid figure he was depositing upon
the lounge. It was a slight, girlish form, and the long
brown hair, loosened from its confinement, fell in rich profusion
over the pillow which ’Lina brought half reluctantly,
eyeing askance the insensible object before her, and
daintily holding back her dress lest it should come in contact
with the child her mother had deposited upon the
floor, where it lay crying lustily, unnoticed save by Rover,
who, quite as awkward as his master would have been
in like circumstances, seemed trying to amuse and protect
it, interposing his shaggy proportions between that and
the fire when once it showed a disposition to creep that
way.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do one of you <em>do something</em>,” Hugh said, as he saw
how indisposed both his mother and sister were to help,
the former being too much frightened and the latter too
indignant to act.</p>

<p class='c011'>The idea of a strange woman being thrust upon them
in this way was highly displeasing to Miss ’Lina, who
haughtily drew back from the little one when it stretched
its arms out toward her, while its pretty lip quivered and
the tears dropped over its rounded cheek. To her it was
nothing but an intruder, a brat, and so she steeled her
heart against its touching appeal, and turned her back upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>it, leaving for Rover the kindly office of soothing the
infant.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meantime Hugh, with all a woman’s tenderness, had
done for the now reviving stranger what he could, and as
his mother began to collect her scattered senses and evince
some interest in the matter, he withdrew to call the negroes,
judging it prudent to remain away awhile, as his
presence might be an intrusion. From the first he had
felt sure that the individual thrown upon his charity was
not a low, vulgar person, as his sister seemed to think.
He had not yet seen her face distinctly, for it lay in the
shadow, but the long, flowing hair, the delicate hands, the
white neck, of which he had caught a glimpse as his
mother unfastened the stiffened dress, all these had made
an impression, and involuntarily repeating to himself,
“Poor girl,” he strode a second time across the drifts
which lay in his back yard and was soon pounding at old
Chloe’s cabin door, bidding her and Hannah dress at once
and come immediately to the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They will need hot water most likely,” he thought
and returning to the kitchen he built the fire himself and
then sat down to wait until such time as it was proper for
him to appear again in the sitting-room, where a strange
scene was enacting.</p>

<p class='c011'>The change of atmosphere and the restoratives applied
had done their work, and Mrs. Worthington saw that the
long eyelashes began to tremble, while a faint color stole
into the hitherto colorless cheeks, and at last the large,
brown eyes unclosed and looked into hers with an expression
so mournful, that a thrill of yearning tenderness for
the desolate young creature shot through her heart, and
bending down she said, kindly, “Are you better now?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, thank you. Where is Willie?” was the low response,
the tone of the voice thrilling Mrs. Worthington
with an undefinable emotion. Even ’Lina started, it was
so low, so sweet, so musical, and coming near she answered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>“If it’s the baby you mean, he is here, playing with
our dog, Rover.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a look of gratitude in the brown eyes, while
the white lips moved slowly, and Mrs. Worthington caught
the whispered words of thanksgiving that baby Willie
was safe.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where am I?” she said next, “and is <em>he</em> here? Is this
his house?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Whose house?” Mrs. Worthington asked. “Whom
are you looking for?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The girl did not answer at once, and when she did her
mind seemed wandering.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I waited so long,” she said, “and watched from morning
till dark, but he never came again, only the letter
which broke my heart. Willie was a wee baby then, and
I almost hated him for awhile, but he wasn’t to blame.
<em>I</em> wasn’t to blame. Our Father in Heaven knew I wasn’t
and after I went to him and told him all about it, and
asked him to care for <em>Adah</em>, the first terrible pain was over
and love for Willie came back with a hope that the letter
might be false. I’m glad God gave me Willie now, even
if he did take his father from me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Worthington and her daughter exchanged curious
glances of wonder, and the latter abruptly asked,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where is Willie’s father?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know,” came in a wailing sob from the depths
of the pillow where the face for a moment hid itself from
view.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where did you come from?” was the next question,
put in a tone so cold and harsh that the young girl looked
up in some alarm, and answered meekly,</p>

<p class='c011'>“From New York, ma’am. It’s a great ways off, and I
thought I’d never get here, but every body was so kind to
me and Willie, and the driver said if ’twan’t so late, and
he so many passengers, he’d drive across the fields. He
pointed out the way and I came on alone. I saw the light
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>off on the hill and tried to hurry, but the snow blinded me
so bad and Willie was so heavy, that I fell down by the
gate, and guess I went to sleep, for I remember dreaming
that the angels were watching over me, and covering
Willie with the snow to keep him warm.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The color had faded now from Mrs. Worthington’s face,
for a terrible suspicion of she scarcely knew what had darted
across her mind, and very timidly she asked again,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Whom did you hope to find?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Worthington. Does he live here?” was the frank
reply; whereupon ’Lina, with crimsoning cheek, drew herself
up haughtily, exclaiming,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I knew it. I’ve thought so ever since Hugh came home
from New York.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In her joy at having, as she supposed, found something
tangible against her provoking brother—some weapon
with which to ward off his offensive attacks upon her own
deceit and want of truth—’Lina forgot that she had never
seen much of him until several months after his return
from New York, at which time she had become, from necessity,
a member of his household and dependent upon
his bounty. ’Lina was unreasonable, and without stopping
to consider the effect her remarks would have upon the
young girl, she was about to commence a tirade of abuse,
when the mother interposed, and with an air of greater
authority than she generally assumed toward her imperious
daughter, bade her keep silence while she questioned
the stranger, gazing wonderingly from one to the other,
as if uncertain what they meant.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Worthington had no such feelings for the girl as
’Lina entertained. If she were anything to Hugh, and the
circumstances thus far favored that belief, then she was
something to Hugh’s mother, and the kind heart of the
matron went out toward her even more strongly than it
had done at first.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It will be easier to talk with you,” she said leaning
forward, “if I knew what to call you.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>“Adah,” was the response, and the brown eyes, swimming
with tears, sought the face of the questioner with a
wistful eagerness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Adah, you say. Well, then, Adah, why have you
come to my son on such a night as this, and what is he to
you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you his mother?” and Adah started up. “I did
not know he had one. Oh, I’m so glad. And you’ll be
kind to me, who never had a mother?”</p>

<p class='c011'>A person who never had a mother was an anomaly to
Mrs. Worthington, whose powers of comprehension were
not the clearest imaginable.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never had a mother!” she repeated. “How can that
be?”</p>

<p class='c011'>A smile flitted for a moment across Adah’s pale face,
and then she answered,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I never knew a mother’s care, I mean. There is some
mystery which I could not fathom, only sometimes there
comes up visions of a cottage with water near, and there’s
a lady there with voice and eyes like yours, and somebody
is teaching me to walk—somebody who calls me little
sister, though I’ve never seen him since. Then there is
confusion, a rolling of wheels, and a hum of some great
city, and that’s all I know of mother.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But your father? What do you know of him?” said
Mrs. Worthington, and instantly a shadow stole into the
sweet young face, as Adah replied, “Nothing definite.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And Hugh? Where did you meet him? And what
is he to you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The only friend I’ve got in the wide world. May I
see him, please?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“First tell what he is to you and to this child,”
’Lina rejoined, her black eyes flashing with a gleam, before
which the brown eyes for an instant quailed; then
as if something of a like spirit were called to life in her
bosom, Adah answered calmly,</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>“Your brother might not like me to tell. I must see
him first—see him alone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“One thing more,” and ’Lina held back her mother
who was starting in quest of Hugh, “are you a wife?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t, ’Lina,” Mrs. Worthington whispered, as she
saw the look of agony pass over Adah’s face. “Don’t
worry her so; deal kindly by the fallen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am not fallen!” came passionately from the quivering
lips. “I’m as true a woman as either of you—look!”
and she pointed to the golden band encircling the
third finger.</p>

<p class='c011'>’Lina was satisfied, and needed no further explanations.
To her, it was plain as daylight. Two years before Hugh
had gone to New York on business connected with his
late uncle’s affairs, and in an unguarded moment had married
some poor girl, whose pretty face had pleased his fancy.
Tiring of her, as of course he would, he had deserted
her, keeping his marriage a secret, and she had followed
him to Spring Bank. These were the facts as ’Lina read
them, and though she despised her brother for it, she was
more than half glad. Hugh could never taunt her again
with double dealing, for wouldn’t she pay him back if he
did, with his neglected, disowned wife and child? She
knew they were his, and it was a resemblance to Hugh,
which she had noticed from the first in Willie’s face.
How glad ’Lina was to have this hold upon her brother,
and how eagerly she went in quest of him, keeping back
old Chloe and Hannah until she had witnessed his humiliation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Somewhat impatient of the long delay, Hugh sat in the
dingy kitchen, watching the tallow candle spluttering in
its iron socket, and wondering who it was he had rescued
from the snow, when ’Lina appeared, and with an air of
injured dignity, bade him follow her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s up now that Ad looks so solemn like?” was
Hugh’s mental comment as he took his way to the room
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>where, in a half reclining position Adah lay, her large,
bright eyes fixed eagerly upon the door through which
he entered, and a bright flush upon her cheek called up
by the suspicions to which she had been subjected.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perhaps they might be true. She did not know. Nobody
knew or could tell her unless it were Hugh, and she
waited for him so anxiously, starting when she heard a
manly step and knew that he was coming. For an instant
she scanned his face curiously to assure herself that
it was he, then with an imploring cry as if for him to
save her from some dreaded evil she stretched her little
hands toward him and sobbed, “Mr. Worthington, was it
true? Was it a real thing, or only sheer mockery, as his
letter said? George, George Hastings, you know,” and
shedding back from her white face the wealth of flowing
hair, Adah waited for the answer, which did not come at
once. In utter amazement Hugh gazed upon the stranger,
and then with an interjection of astonishment, exclaimed,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Adah, Adah Hastings, why are you here?”</p>

<p class='c011'>In the tone of his voice surprise was mingled with disapprobation,
the latter of which Adah, detected at once,
and as if it had crushed out the last lingering hope, she
covered her face with her hands and sobbed piteously,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t you turn against me, or I’ll surely die, and I’ve
come so far to find you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>By this time Hugh was himself again. His rapid,
quick-seeing mind had taken in both the past and the
present, and turning to his mother and sister, he said,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Leave us alone for a time. I will call you when you
are needed and, Ad, remember, no listening by the door,”
he continued, as he saw how disappointed ’Lina seemed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rather reluctantly Mrs. Worthington and her daughter
left the room, and Hugh was alone with Adah, whose
face was still hidden in her hands, and whose body shook
with strong emotion. Deliberately turning the key in the
lock, Hugh advanced to her side, and kneeling by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>couch, said, kindly, “I am more pained to see you here
than I can well express. Why did you come, and where
is——?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The name was lost to ’Lina, listening outside, in spite
of her brother’s injunction. Neither could she understand
the passionate, inaudible response. She only knew
that sobs and tears were mingled with it, that there was
a rustling of paper, which Adah bade Hugh read, asking
if it were true. This was all ’Lina could hear, and muttering
to herself, “It does not sound much like man and
wife,” she rather unwillingly quitted her position, and
Hugh was really alone with Adah.</p>

<p class='c011'>Never was Hugh in so awkward a position before, or so
uncertain how to act. The sight of that sobbing, trembling,
wretched creature, had perfectly unmanned him,
making him almost as much a woman as herself. Sitting
down by her side, he laid her poor aching head upon his
own broad bosom, and pushing back her long, bright hair,
tried to soothe her into quiet, while he candidly confessed
that he feared the letter was true. It had occurred to
him at the time, he said, that all was not right, but he had
no suspicion that it could be so bad as it now seemed or
he would have felled to the floor every participant in the
cruel farce, which had so darkened Adah’s life. It was a
dastardly act, he said, pressing closer to him the light
form quivering with anguish. He knew how innocent
she was, and he held her in his arms as he would once
have held the Golden Haired had she come to him with
a tale of woe.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let me see that letter again,” he said, and taking the
rumpled sheet, stained with Adah’s tears, he turned it to
the light and read once more the cruel lines, in which
there was still much of love and pity for the poor helpless
thing, to whom they were addressed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will surely find friends who will care for you,
until the time when I may come to really make you
mine.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Hugh repeated these words twice, aloud, his lip curling
with contempt for the man who could so coolly thrust upon
others a charge which should have been so sacred; and
his heart, throbbing with the noble resolve, that the confidence
she had placed in him by coming there, should not
be abused, for he would be true to the trust, and care for
poor, little, half-crazed Adah, moaning so piteously beside
him, and as he read the last line, saying eagerly,</p>

<p class='c011'>“He speaks of coming back. Do you think he ever
will? or could I find him if I should try? I thought of
starting once, but it was so far; and there was Willie.
Oh, if he could see Willie! Mr. Worthington, do you
believe he loves me one bit?” and in the eyes there was
a look as if the poor creature were famishing for the love
whose existence she was questioning.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hugh did not understand the nature of a love which
could so deliberately abandon one like Adah. It was not
such love as he had cherished for the Golden Haired,
but men were not alike; and so he said, at last, that the
letter contained many assurances of affection, and pleadings
for forgiveness for the great wrong committed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It seems family pride has something to do with it. I
wonder where his people live, or who they are? Did he
never tell you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” and Adah shook her head mournfully. “There
was something strange about it. He never gave me the
slightest clue. He only told how proud they were, and
how they would spurn a poor girl like me; and said, we
must keep it a secret until he had won them over. If I
could only find them!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Would you go to them?” Hugh asked quickly; and
Adah answered,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sometimes I’ve thought I would. I’d brave his proud
mother—I’d lay Willie in her lap. I’d tell her whose he
was, and then I’d go away and die. They could not harm
my Willie!” and the young girl mother glanced proudly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>at her sleeping boy. Then, after a pause, she continued,
“Once, Mr. Worthington, when my brain was all on fire,
I went down to the river, and said I’d end my wretched
life, but God, who was watching me, held me back. He
cooled my scorching head—he eased the pain, and on
the very spot where I meant to jump, I kneeled down and
said, ‘Our Father.’ No other words would come, only
these, ‘Lead us not into temptation.’ Wasn’t it kind in
God to save me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a radiant expression in the sweet face as Adah
said this, but it quickly passed away and was succeeded
by one of deep concern, when Hugh abruptly asked,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you believe in God?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Mr. Worthington. Don’t you? You do, you
must, you will,” and Adah shrank away from him as from
a monster.</p>

<p class='c011'>The action reminded him of the Golden Haired, when
on the deck of the St. Helena he had asked her a similar
question, and anxious further to probe the opinion of the
girl beside him, he continued,</p>

<p class='c011'>“If, as you think, there is a God who knew and saw
when you were about to drown yourself, why didn’t he
prevent the cruel wrong to you? Why did he suffer
it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What He does we know not now, but we shall know
hereafter,” Adah said, reverently, adding, “If George had
feared God, he would not have left me so; but he didn’t,
and perhaps he says there is no God—but you don’t,
Mr. Worthington. Your face don’t look like it. Tell me
you believe,” and in her eagerness Adah grasped his arm
beseechingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Adah, I believe,” Hugh answered, half jestingly,
“but it’s such as you that make me believe, and as persons
of your creed think every thing is ordered for good,
so possibly you were permitted to suffer that you might
come here and benefit me. I think I must keep you until
he is found.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>“No, no,” and the tears flowed at once, “I cannot be a
burthen to you. I have no claim.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why then did you come at all?” Hugh asked, and
Adah answered,</p>

<p class='c011'>“For a time after I received the letter every thing was
so dark that I didn’t realize, and couldn’t think of any
thing. But when the landlady hinted those terrible
things, and finally told me I must leave to give place to
a respectable woman, that’s just what she said, a <em>respectable</em>
woman, with a child who knew its own father, then I
woke up and tried to think of something, but the more I
tried, the more I couldn’t, till at last I prayed so hard one
night, that God would tell me what to do, and suddenly
I remembered you and your good, kind, honest face, just
as it looked when you spoke to me after it was over, and
called me by the new name. Oh, dear, oh, dear,” and
gasping for breath, Adah leaned against Hugh’s arm, sobbing
bitterly.</p>

<p class='c011'>After a moment she grew calm again, and continued,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wrote down your name, and where you lived, though
why I did not know, and I forgot where I put it, but as if
God really were helping me I found it in my old portfolio,
and something bade me come, for you perhaps would
know if it was true. It was sometime before I could
fully decide to come, and in that time I hardly know how I
lived, or where. George left me money, and sent more,
but it’s most gone now. But I must not stay. I can
take care of myself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What can you do?” Hugh asked, and Adah replied,
sadly,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know, but God will find me something. I
never worked much, but I can learn, and I can already
sew neatly, too; besides that, a few days before I decided
to come here, I advertised in the Herald for some
place as governess or ladies’ waiting-maid. Perhaps I’ll
hear from that.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>“It’s hardly possible. Such advertisements are thick
as blackberries,” Hugh said, and then in a few brief
words, he marked out Adah’s future course.</p>

<p class='c011'>George Hastings might or might not return to claim
her, and whether he did or didn’t, she must live meantime,
and where so well as at Spring Bank.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not like women much,” he said, “but something
makes me like you, pity, I reckon, and I’m going to take
care of you until that scoundrel turns up; then, if you
say so, I’ll surrender you to his care, or better yet, I’ll
shoot him and keep you to myself. Not as a sweetheart,
or anything of that kind,” he hastened to add, as he saw
the flush on Adah’s cheek. “Hugh Worthington has
nothing to do with that species of the animal kingdom,
but as my sister Adah!” and as Hugh repeated that name,
there arose in his great heart an undefinable wish that
the gentle girl beside him had been his sister instead of
the high tempered Adaline, who never tried to conciliate
or understand him, and whom Hugh could not love as
brothers should love sisters.</p>

<p class='c011'>He knew how impatiently she was waiting now to know
the result of that interview, and just how much opposition
he should meet when he announced his intention of keeping
Adah. But Hugh was master of Spring Bank; his
will was all powerful, and not an entire world could move
him when once he was determined. Still contention was
not agreeable, and he oftentimes yielded a point rather
than dispute. But this time he was firm. Without any
intention of wronging Adah, he still felt as if in some
way he had been instrumental to her ruin, and now when
she came to him for help, he would not cast her off,
though the keeping her would subject him to a multitude
of unpleasant remarks, surmises and suspicions from the
people of Glen’s Creek, to say nothing of his mother’s
and ’Lina’s displeasure. Added to this was another objection,
a serious one, which most men would have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>weighed carefully before deciding to burden themselves
with two additional individuals. Though the owner of
Spring Bank, Hugh was far from being rich, and many
were the shifts and self denials he was obliged to make
to meet the increased expense entailed upon him by his
mother and sister. John Stanley had been accounted
wealthy, but at his death there was nothing left, save a
few acres of nearly worn out land, the old dilapidated
house, and a dozen or more negroes. With good management
this was amply sufficient to supply Hugh’s limited
wants, and he was looking forward to a life of careless
ease, when his mother from New England wrote, asking
for a home. Hugh did not know then as well as he did
now what it would cost to keep a young lady of his sister’s
habits. He only knew that his home was far different
from the New England one he remembered so well,
but such as it was he would share it with his mother and
sister, and so he had bidden them welcome, concealing
from them as far as possible the trouble he oftentimes had
to meet the increased demand for money which their presence
brought. This to a certain extent was the secret of his
patched boots, his threadbare coat and coarse pants, with
which ’Lina so often taunted him, saying he wore them
just to be stingy and mortify her, when in fact necessity
rather than choice was the cause of his shabby appearance.
He had never told her so, however, never said that
the unfashionable coat so offensive to her fastidious vision
was worn that she might be the better clothed and fed.
Yet such was the case, and now he was deliberately adding
to his already heavy burden. But Hugh was capable
of great self sacrifices. He could manage somehow,
and Adah should stay. He would say that she was a
friend whom he had known in New York; that her husband
had deserted her, and in her distress she had come
to him for aid; for the rest he trusted that time and her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>own appearance would wear away any unpleasant impressions
which her presence might create.</p>

<p class='c011'>All this he explained to Adah, who assented tacitly
thinking within herself that she should not long remain
at Spring Bank, a dependant upon one on whom she had no
claim. She was too weak now, however, to oppose him,
and merely nodding to his suggestions laid her head upon
the arm of the lounge with a low cry that she was sick
and warm. Stepping to the door Hugh turned the key
and summoning the group waiting anxiously in the adjoining
room, bade them come at once, as Mrs. Hastings appeared
to be fainting. Great emphasis he laid upon the
<em>Mrs.</em> and catching it up at once ’Lina repeated, “<em>Mrs.
Hastings!</em> So am I just as much.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ad,” and the eyes which shone so softly on poor Adah
flashed with gleams of fire as Hugh said to his sister,
“not another word against that girl if you wish to remain
here longer. She has been unfortunate.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I guessed as much,” sneeringly interrupted ’Lina.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Silence!” and Hugh’s foot came down as it sometimes
did when chiding a refractory negro. “She is as true, yes,
truer than you. He who should have protected her has
basely deserted her. And I shall care for her. See that
a fire is kindled in the west chamber, and go up yourself
when it is made and see that all is comfortable. Do you
understand?” and he gazed sternly at ’Lina, who was too
much astonished to answer, even if she had been so disposed.</p>

<p class='c011'>That Hugh should take in a beggar from the streets was
bad enough, but to keep her, and worse yet to put her in
the best chamber, where ex-Governor Russ had slept; and
where was nailed down the carpet, brought from New
England—was preposterous, and Hugh was certainly
crazy. But never was man more sane than Hugh; and
seeing her apparently incapable of carrying out his orders
he himself sent Hannah to build the fire, bidding her, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>all a woman’s forethought, be careful that the bed was aired,
and clothes enough put on. “Take a blanket from my
bed, if necessary,” he added, as Hannah, bewildered with
the “carryin’s on,” disappeared up the staircase, a long line
of smoke streaming behind her.</p>

<p class='c011'>When all was ready, Hugh went for Adah, and taking
her in his arms carried her to the upper chamber, where,
the fire was burning brightly, casting cheerful shadows
upon the wall, and making Adah smile gratefully, as she
looked up in his face, and murmured,</p>

<p class='c011'>“God bless you, Mr. Worthington! Adah will pray for
you to-night, when she is alone. It’s all that she can do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They laid her upon the bed. Hugh himself arranging
her pillows, which no one else appeared inclined to touch.</p>

<p class='c011'>Family opinion was against her, innocent and beautiful
as she looked lying there—so helpless, so still, with her
long-fringed lashes shading her colorless cheek, and her
little hands folded upon her bosom, as if already she were
breathing the promised prayer for Hugh. Only in Mrs.
Worthington’s heart was there a chord of sympathy. She
couldn’t help feeling for the desolate stranger; and when,
at her own request, Hannah placed Willie in her lap, ere
laying him by his mother, she gave him an involuntary hug,
and touched her lips to his fat, round cheek. It was the
first kiss given him at Spring Bank, and it was meet that
it should come from her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He looks as you did, Hugh, when you were a baby,”
she said, while Chloe rejoined,</p>

<p class='c011'>“De very spawn of Mar’s Hugh, now. I ’tected it de
fust minit. Can’t cheat dis chile,” and, with a chuckle
which she meant to be very expressive, the fat old woman
waddled from the room, followed by Hannah, who
was to sleep there that night, and who must first return
to her cabin to make the necessary preparations for her
vigils.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Hugh and his mother were alone, and turning to her
son, Mrs. Worthington said, gently,</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is sad business, Hugh; worse than you imagine.
Do you know how folks will talk?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let them talk,” Hugh growled. “It cannot be much
worse than it is now. Nobody cares for Hugh Worthington;
and why should they, when his own mother and sister
are against him, in actions if not in words?—one
sighing when his name is mentioned, as if he really were
the most provoking son that ever was born, and the other
openly berating him as a monster, a clown, a savage, a
scarecrow, and all that. I tell you, mother, there is but
little to encourage me in the kind of life I’m leading.
Neither you nor Ad have tried to make anything of me
or have done me any good; but somehow, I feel as if she
would,” and he pointed to the now sleeping Adah. “At
all events, I know it’s right to keep her, and I want you
to help me, will you? That is, will you be kind to her;
and when folks speak against her, as they may, will you
stand for her as for your own daughter? She’s more like
you than Ad,” and Hugh gazed wonderingly from one to
the other, struck, for the first time, with a resemblance,
fancied or real, between the two.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Worthington did not heed this last, so intent was
she on the first of Hugh’s remarks. Choking with tears
she said,</p>

<p class='c011'>“You wrong me, Hugh; I do try to make something
of you. You are a dear child to me, dearer than the other;
but I’m a weak woman, and ’Lina sways me at will.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A kind word unmanned Hugh at once, and kneeling by
his mother, he put his arms around her, and begging forgiveness
for his harsh words, asked again a mother’s care
for Adah.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hugh,” and Mrs. Worthington looked him steadily in
the face, “is Adah your wife, or Willie your child?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Great guns, mother!” and Hugh started to his feet as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>quick as if a bombshell had exploded at his side. “No
by all that’s sacred, no! Upon my word; you look sorry
instead of glad! Are you sorry, mother, to find me better
than you imagined it possible for a bad boy like me
to be?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Hugh, not sorry. I was only thinking that I’ve
sometimes fancied that, as a married man, you might be
happier; and when this woman came so strangely,
and you seemed so interested, I didn’t know, I rather
thought——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know,” and Hugh interrupted her. “You thought
maybe, I raised Ned when I was in New York; and, as a
proof of said resurrection, Mrs. Ned and Ned junior, had
come with their baggage. But it is not so, she does not
belong to me,” and going up to his mother he told her all
he knew of Adah, adding, “Now will you be kind to her
for my sake? and when Ad rides her highest horse, as
she is sure to do, will you smooth her down? Tell her
Adah has as good right here as she, if I choose to keep
her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a faint remonstrance on Mrs. Worthington’s
part, her argument being based upon what folks would
say, and Hugh’s inability to take care of many more.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hugh did not care a picayune for <em>folks</em>, and as for
Adah, if his mother did not wish her there, and he presumed
she did not, he’d get her boarded for the present
with Aunt Eunice, who, like himself, was invincible to
public opinion, she needed just such a companion. She’d
be a mother to Adah, and Adah a daughter to her, so
they needn’t spend further time in talking, for he was
getting tired.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Worthington was much more easily won over to
Hugh’s opinion than ’Lina, who, when told of the arrangement,
raised a perfect hurricane of expostulations and
tears. They’d be a county talk, she said; nobody would
come near them, and she might as well enter a nunnery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>at once; besides, hadn’t Hugh enough on his hands already
without taking more?</p>

<p class='c011'>“If my considerate sister really thinks so, hadn’t she
better try and help herself a little?” retorted Hugh in a
blaze of anger. “I’ve only paid two hundred and fifty
dollars for her since she came here, to say nothing of
that bill at Harney’s due in January.”</p>

<p class='c011'>’Lina began to cry, and Hugh, repenting of his harsh
speech as soon as it was uttered, but far too proud to take
it back, strode up and down the room, chafing like a
young lion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, children, it’s after midnight, let us adjourn
until to-morrow,” Mrs. Worthington said, by way of ending
the painful interview, at the same time handing a candle
to Hugh, who took it silently and withdrew, banging
the door behind him with a force which made ’Lina start
and burst into a fresh flood of tears.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m a brute, a savage,” was Hugh’s not very self complimentary
soliloquy, as he went up the stairs. “What
did I want to twit Ad for? What good did it do, only
to make her mad and bother mother? I wish I could do
better, but I can’t. Confound my badness!” and having
by this time reached his own door, Hugh entered his room,
and drawing a chair to the fire always kindled for him
at night, sat down to think.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER III.<br> <span class='large'>HUGH’S SOLILOQUY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“One, two, three, yes, as good as four women and a
child,” he began, “to say nothing of the negroes, who all
must eat and drink. A goodly number for one whose
income is hardly as much as some young men spend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>every year upon themselves; and the hardest of all is
the having people call me stingy and mean, the seeing
young girls lift their eyebrows and wink when young
Hunks, as Ad says they call me, appears, and the knowing
that this opinion of me is encouraged and kept alive
by the remarks and insinuations of my own sister, for
whom I’ve denied myself more than one new coat that
she might have the dress she coveted,” and in the red
gleam of the firelight the bearded chin quivered for a
moment as Hugh thought how unjust ’Lina was to him,
and how hard was the lot imposed upon him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Soon recovering his composure he continued, “There’s
that bill at Harney’s, how in the world I’m to pay it when
it comes due is more than I know. These duds,” and he
glanced ruefully at his coarse clothes, “will look a heap
worse than they do now,” and shifting the position of his
feet, which had hitherto rested upon the hearth, to a more
comfortable and suggestive one upon the mantel, Hugh
tried to find a spot in which he could economize.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I needn’t have a fire in my room nights,” he said, as a
coal fell into the pan and thus reminded him of its existence,
“and I won’t, either. It’s nonsense for a great hot-blooded
clown like me to be babied with a fire. I’ve no
tags to braid, no false switches to comb out and hide, only
a few buttons to undo, a shake or so, and I’m all right.
So there’s one thing, the fire—quite an item, too, at the
rate coal is selling. Then there’s coffee. I can do without
that, I suppose, though it will be perfect torment to smell
it, and Hannah makes such splendid coffee, too; but will
is everything. Fire, coffee—I’m getting on famously.
What else?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Tobacco</em>,” something whispered, but Hugh answered
promptly, “No, sir, I shan’t! I’ll sell my shirts, before
I’ll give up my best friend. It’s all the comfort I have
when I get a fit of the blues. Oh, you needn’t try to come
it!” and Hugh shook his head defiantly at his unseen interlocutor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>urging that ’twas a filthy practice at best, and
productive of no good. “You needn’t try for I won’t,”
and Hugh deliberately lighted a cigar and resumed his
soliloquy, while he complacently watched the little blue
rings curling so gracefully above his head. “Blamed if
I can think of any thing else, but maybe I shall. I might
sell something, I suppose. There’s Harney wants to buy
Bet, but Ad never rides any other horse, and she does ride
uncommonly well, if she <em>is</em> Ad. There’s the negroes, more
than I need,” but from this suggestion Hugh turned away
quite as decidedly as from the one touching his tobacco.
“He didn’t believe much in negroes any way, surely not
in selling them; besides that, nobody’d want them after
they’d been spoiled as he had spoiled them,” and he laughed
aloud as he fancied a new master trying to break in old
Chloe, who had ruled at Spring Bank so long that she almost
fancied she owned it. No, Hugh wouldn’t sell his
servants, and the negroes sleeping so soundly in their cabins
had nothing to fear from him.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Horses</em> were suggested again. “You have other horses
than Bet,” and Hugh was conscious of a pang which wrung
from him a groan, for his horses were his idols, and parting
with them would be like severing a right hand. It was too
terrible to think about, and Hugh dismissed it as an alternative
which might have to be considered another time.
Then hope made her voice heard above the little blue imps
tormenting him so sadly.</p>

<p class='c011'>He should get along somehow. Something would turn
up. Ad might marry and go away. He knew it was
wrong, and yet he could not help thinking it would be
nice to come home some day and not find her there, with
her fault-finding, and her sarcastic remarks. What made
her so different from his mother—so different from the
little sister he always remembered with a throb of delight?
He had loved her, and he thought of her now as she used
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>to look in her dainty white frocks, with the strings of coral
he had bought with nuts picked on the New England hills.</p>

<p class='c011'>He used to kiss her chubby arms—kiss the rosy cheeks,
and the soft brown hair. But that hair had changed sadly
since the days when its owner had first lisped his name,
and called him “Ugh,” for the bands and braids coiled
around ’Lina’s head were black as midnight. Not less
changed than ’Lina’s tresses was ’Lina herself, and Hugh
had often felt like crying for the little baby sister, so lost
and dead to him in her young womanhood. What had
changed Ad so? To be sure he did not care much for
females any way, but if Ad were half way decent, and
would let him, he should love her, he presumed. Other
young men loved their sisters. There was Bob Reynolds
seemed to idolize his, crippled though she was, and he had
mourned so bitterly, when she died, bending over her coffin,
and kissing her white face. Would Hugh do so to
Ad? He thought it very doubtful! though, he supposed,
he should feel sorry and mourn some, but he’d bet he
wouldn’t wear a very wide band of crape around his hat;
he couldn’t afford it! Still he should remember all the
harsh things he had said to her, and be so sorry.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was many a tender spot in Hugh Worthington’s
heart, and shadow after shadow flitted across his face as
he thought how cheerless was his life, and how little
there was in his surroundings to make him happy. Poor
Hugh! It was a dreary picture he drew as he sat alone
that night, brooding over his troubles, and listening to the
moan of the wintry wind—the only sound he heard, except
the rattling of the shutters and the creaking of the
timbers, as the old house rocked in the December gale.</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly there crept into his mind Adah’s words, “I
shall pray for you to-night.” Would she? Had she
prayed for him, and did prayers do any good? Was any
one bettered by them? Golden Hair had thought so, and
he was sure she had talked with God of him, but since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>the waters closed over her dear head, no one had remembered
Hugh Worthington in that way, he was sure. But
Adah would, and Hugh’s heart grew stronger as he
thought of Adah praying for him. What would she say?
How would she word it? He wished he knew, but prayer
was strange to Hugh. He <em>never</em> prayed, and the Bible
given by Golden Hair had not been opened this many a
day, but he would do so now, and unlocking the trunk
where it was hidden, he took it from its concealment and
opened it reverently, half wondering what he should read
first and if it would have any reference to his present
position.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Inasmuch as ye did it to the least of these ye did it
unto me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>That was what Hugh read in the dim twilight, that, the
passage on which the lock of hair lay, and the Bible
dropped from his hands as he whispered,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Golden Hair, are you here? Did you point that out
to me? Does it mean Adah? Is the God you loved on
earth pleased that I should care for her?”</p>

<p class='c011'>To these queries, there came no answer, save the mournful
wailing of the night wind roaring down the chimney
and past the sleet-covered window, but Hugh was a happier
man for reading that, and had there before existed a
doubt as to his duty toward Adah, this would have swept
it away. Bending closer to the fire, Hugh read the chapter
through, wondering why he should feel so much better,
and why the world looked brighter than it had an hour
before. If it made folks feel so nice to read a little bit in
the Bible, how would they feel to read it through? He
meant to try and see, beginning at Genesis the very next
night, and hiding his treasure away, Hugh sought his pillow
just as the first greyish streak of daylight was beginning
to show in the east.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER IV<br> <span class='large'>TERRACE HILL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The storm which visited Kentucky so wrathfully was
far milder among the New England hills, and in the vicinity
of Snowdon, whither our story now tends, was scarcely
noticed, save as an ordinary winter’s storm. There were
no drifts against the fences, no driving sleet, no sheets of
ice covering the valleys, nothing save a dark, sour, dreary
day, when the grey December clouds seemed wading in
the piles of snow, which, as the sun went down, began to
fall in those small misty flakes, which betoken a storm of
some duration. As yet it had been comparatively warmer
in New England than in Kentucky; and Miss Anna Richards,
confirmed invalid though she was, had decided not
to take her usual trip to the South, so comfortable was she
at home, in her accustomed chair, with her pretty crimson
shawl wrapped around her. Besides that, they were expecting
her brother John from Paris, where he had been
for the last eighteen months, pursuing his medical profession,
and she must be there to welcome him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna was proud of her young, handsome brother, for
on him and his success in life, all their future hopes were
pending.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>All</em> were proud of John, and all had petted and spoiled
him, from his precise lady mother, down to invalid Anna,
who, more than any one else, was anxious for his return,
and who had entered, with a good deal of interest into
the preparations which, for a week or more, had kept
Terrace Hill Mansion in a state of bustle and excitement,
for John was so refined and fastidious in his tastes, that
he was sure to notice if aught were amiss or out of place.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>Consequently great pains was taken with his room, while
Anna, who had a private purse of her own, went into the
extravagance of furnishing a new carpet of more modern
style than the heavy, old-fashioned Brussels, which for
years, had covered the floor.</p>

<p class='c011'>John had never been very happy at home—and hence
the efforts they were putting forth to make it attractive to
him after his long absence. He could not help liking it
now, the ladies said to each other, as, a few days before
his arrival, they rode from the village, up the winding
terraced hill, admiring the huge stone building embosomed
in evergreens, and standing out so distinctly against
the wintry sky. And Terrace Hill Mansion was a very
handsome place, exciting the envy and admiration of the
villagers, who could remember a time when it had looked
better even than it did now—when the house was oftener
full of city company, when high-born ladies rode up and
down in carriages, or dashed on horseback through the
park and off into leafy woods—when sounds of festivity
were heard in the halls from year’s end to year’s end, and
the lights in the parlors were rarely extinguished, or the
fires on the hearth put out. This was during the lifetime
of its former owner, whose covering had been the tall green
grass of Snowdon cemetery for several years. With his
death there had come a change to the inhabitants of Terrace
Hill, a curtailing of expenses, a gradual dropping of
the swarms of friends who had literally fed upon them during
the summer and autumn months. In short it was
whispered now that the ladies of Terrace Hill were restricted
in their means, that there was less display of dress and
style, fewer fires, and lights, and servants, and an apparent
desire to be left to themselves.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was what the village people whispered, and none
knew the truth of the whisperings better than the ladies
in question, or shrank more from having their affairs
canvassed by those whom they looked down upon, even if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>the glory of their house was departed. Mrs. Richards
and her elder daughters, Miss Asenath and Eudora, were
very proud, very exclusive, and but for the existence of
Anna, few of the villagers would ever have crossed their
threshold. Anna was a favorite in the village, and when
confined to her room for weeks, as she sometimes was,
there were more anxious enquiries concerning her than
would have been bestowed on Asenath and Eudora had
they both been dying. And yet in her early girlhood
she too had been cold and haughty, but since the morning
when she had knelt at her father’s feet, and begged him
to revoke his cruel decision, and say she might be the
bride of a poor missionary, Anna had greatly changed,
and the father had sometimes questioned the propriety
of separating the hearts which clung so tenaciously together.
But it was then too late to remedy the mistake.
The young missionary had married another, and neither
the parents nor the sisters ever forgot the look of anguish
which stole into Anna’s face, when she heard the news.
She had told him to do so, it is true, for she knew a missionary
to be strictly useful must have a wife. She had
thought herself prepared, but the news was just as crushing
when it came, accompanied though it was with a few
last lines from <em>him</em>, such as a husband might write to the
woman he had loved so much, and only given up because
he must. Anna kept this letter yet, reading it often to
herself, and wondering, if through all the changes which
fourteen years had wrought, the missionary remembered
her yet, and if they would ever meet again. This was
the secret of the numerous missionary papers and magazines
scattered so profusely through the rooms at Terrace
Hill. Anna was interested in everything pertaining to
the work, though, it must be confessed, that her mind
wandered oftenest to the city of mosques and minarets,
where <em>he</em> was laboring; and once, when she heard of a
little grave made with the Moslem dead, the grave of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>darling Anna, named for her, she wept bitterly, feeling as
if she, too, had been bereaved as well as the parents,
across the Eastern waters. This was sweet Anna Richards,
who, on the day of her brother’s expected arrival
from Paris, dressed herself with unusual care and joined
her mother and elder sisters in the parlor below. It was
a raw, chilly evening, and a coal fire had been kindled in the
grate, the bright blaze falling on Anna’s cheek, and lighting
it up with something like the youthful bloom for
which she had once been celebrated. The harsh expression
of Miss Asenath’s face was softened down, while the
mother and Eudora looked anxiously expectant, and
Anna was the happiest of them all. Taken as a whole
it was a very pleasant family group, which sat there waiting
for the foreign lion, and for the whistle of the engine
which was to herald his approach.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wonder if he has changed,” said the mother, glancing
at the opposite mirror and arranging the puffs of
glossy false hair which shaded her aristocratic forehead.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course he has,” returned Miss Asenath. “Nearly
two years of Paris society must have imparted to him that
<i><span lang="fr">air distingue</span></i> so desirable in a young man who has travelled.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He’ll hardly fail of making a good match now,” Miss
Eudora remarked. “I think we must manage to visit
Saratoga or some of those places next summer. Mr.
Gardner found his wife at Newport, and they say she’s
worth half a million.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But horridly ugly,” and Anna looked up from the
reverie in which she had been indulging. “Lottie says she
has tow hair and a face like a fish. John would never be
happy with such a wife.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Possibly you think he had better have married that
sewing girl about whom he wrote us just before going to
Europe,” Miss Eudora suggested.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I don’t,” Anna answered, mildly. “I am almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>as anxious as yourselves for him to marry rich, for I know
you need money sadly, and my income is not so large as
for your sakes I wish it was, but poverty and love are
better than riches and hatred, and I have always felt a
strange interest in that young girl, whom I know John
loved, or he would never have written to see how we
would bear his taking a portionless bride.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I told him plainly how <em>I</em> would bear it. She should
never cross <em>my</em> threshold,” and the face of Mrs. Richards,
the mother, was highly indicative of the feeling she entertained
for the young, penniless girl, whom it would
seem John Richards M. D., had thought to marry.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I trust he is over that fancy,” she continued, “and
ready to thank me for the strong letter I wrote him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, but the girl,” and Anna leaned her white cheek
in her whiter hand. “None of us know the harm his
leaving her may have done. Don’t you remember he
wrote how much she loved him—how gentle and confiding
her nature was, how to leave her then might prove
her ruin?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Our little Anna is growing very eloquent upon the
subject of sewing girls,” Miss Asenath said, rather scornfully,
and Anna rejoined,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am not sure she was a sewing girl. He spoke of
her as a school girl.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But it is most likely he did that to mislead us,” said
the mother. “The only boarding school he knows anything
about is the one where Lottie was. He often visited
her, but I’ve questioned her closely, and she cannot
think of a single young lady whom he fancied more than
another. All were in love with him, she said, herself included.
If he were not her uncle by marriage I should
not object to Lottie as a daughter,” was the next remark,
whereupon there ensued a conversation touching the merits
and demerits of a certain Lottie Gardner, whose father
had taken for a second wife Miss Laura Richards.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>During this discussion of Lottie, Anna had sat listlessly
looking up and down the columns of an old Herald
which Dick, Eudora’s pet dog, had ferreted out from the
table and deposited at her feet. She evidently was not
thinking of Lottie, nor yet of the advertisements, until
one struck her notice as being very singular from the fact
that a name was appended to it, a thing she had never
seen before. Holding it a little more to the light and
bending forward she said, “Possibly this is the very person
I want—one who will be either a companion or a
waiting-maid, only the child might be an objection, though
I do love the little things. Just listen,” and Anna read
as follows:</p>

<p class='c012'>“<span class='sc'>Wanted</span>—by an unfortunate young married woman,
with a child a few months old, a situation in a private family
either as governess, seamstress, or lady’s maid. Country
preferred. Address ——”</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna was about to say whom, when a violent ringing
of the bell and a heavy stamping of feet on the steps with
out announced an arrival, and the next moment a tall,
handsome young man, exceedingly Frenchified in his appearance,
entered the room, and was soon in the arms of his
mother, who, kissing his bearded cheek, welcomed him as
her son.</p>

<p class='c011'>John, or Dr. Richards, did not care particularly to be
caressed by ladies unless he could choose them, and releasing
himself as soon as practicable from his lady mother’s
embrace, he submitted himself a moment to his two elder
sisters, and then, hastening to where Anna sat, wound
his arms around her light figure, and lifting her as he would
have lifted a little child, kissed her white lips and looked
into her face with an expression which told that, however
indifferent he might be to others, he was not so to Anna.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have not changed for the worse,” he said, replacing
her in her chair and sitting down beside her.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>“And you are vastly improved,” was Anna’s answer, as
she smoothed playfully the Parisian mustache, her brother’s
special pride.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then commenced from mother and sisters a volley of
questions. Had he been well? Did he like Paris? Was
he glad to be home again? And why had he gone off
without coming out to say good-bye?</p>

<p class='c011'>This last was put by his mother, who continued, “I
thought, perhaps, you were offended at my plain letter
concerning that girl, and resented it by not coming, but of
course you are glad now, and see that mother was right.
What could you have done with a wife in Paris?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should not have gone,” John answered, moodily, a
shadow stealing over his face.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not good taste for Mrs. Richards thus early to introduce
a topic on which John was really so sore, and for
a moment an awkward silence ensued, broken at last by
the mother again, who, feeling that all was not right, and
anxious to know if there was yet aught to fear from a poor,
unknown daughter-in-law, asked, hesitatingly,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you seen her since your return?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She is <em>dead</em> was the reply, and then anxious to change
the conversation, the Doctor began talking to Anna until
the supper bell rang, and his mother led the way to the
dining room where a most inviting supper was prepared
in honor of <em>the Doctor’s</em> return. How handsome he looked
in his father’s place at the head of the table. How
gracefully he did the honors, and how proud all were of
him as he repeated little incidents of Parisian life, speaking
of the Emperor and Eugenie as if they had been
every day sights to him. In figure and form the fair Empress
reminded him of Anna, he said, except that Anna
was the prettier of the two—a compliment which Anna
acknowledged with a blush and a trembling of her long
eyelashes. It was a very pleasant family reunion, for John
did his best to be agreeable, and by the time they returned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>to the parlor his mother had quite forgiven him the flagrant
act of loving an unknown girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, John, please be careful where you tear that paper.
There’s an advertisement I want to save,” Anna exclaimed,
as she saw her brother tearing a strip from the Herald
with which to light his cigar, but as she spoke, the smoke
and flame curled around the narrow strip, and Dr. Richards
had lighted his cigar with the name and address appended
to the advertisement which had so interested
Anna.</p>

<p class='c011'>How disturbed she was when she found that nought
was left save the simple wants of the young girl who,
with a breaking heart had penned the lines, and who now
lay so still beneath a Kentucky rift of snow!</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let’s see,” and taking the mutilated sheet, Dr. Richards
read the “Wanted, by a young unfortunate married
woman.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That unfortunate may mean a great deal more than
you imagine,” he said, in order to quiet his sister, who
quickly rejoined,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, but she distinctly says married. Don’t you see,
and I had really some idea of writing to her, or at least
I think I had, now that ’tis too late.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m sorry I was so careless, but there are a thousand
unfortunate women who would gladly be your maid,
little sister. I’ll send you out a score, if you say so,
either with or without babies,” and John laughed, as with
the utmost nonchalance he smoked the cigar lighted with
the name of <em>Adah Hastings</em>!</p>

<p class='c011'>“Has any thing of importance occurred in this slow old
town?” he inquired, after Anna had become reconciled to
her loss. “Has there been any desirable addition to
Snowdon society?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” returned Anna. “A Mrs. Johnson, who is
every way cultivated and refined, while Alice is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>sweetest girl I ever knew. You have a rare pleasure in
store in forming their acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Whose, the old or the young lady’s?” John asked,
carelessly knocking the ashes from the end of his cigar.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Both,” was Anna’s reply. “The mother is very
youthful in her appearance. Why, she scarcely looks
older than I do, and I, you know, am thirty-two.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As if fearful lest her own age should come next under
consideration, Miss Eudora hastened to say,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Mrs. Johnson does look very young, and Alice
seems like a child, though I heard her say she was almost
twenty. Such beautiful hair as she has. It used to
be a bright yellow, or golden, so the old nurse says, but
now it has a darker, richer shade, midway between golden
and chestnut, while her eyes are the softest, handsomest
blue.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice Johnson was evidently a favorite at Terrace Hill,
and as this stamped her somebody John began to ask who
the Johnsons were, and where they came from.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Richard seemed disposed to answer these questions,
which she did as follows:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mrs. Johnson used to live in Boston, and her husband
was grandson of old Governor Johnson, one of the best
families in that State.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, yes,” and John began to laugh. “I see now what
gives Miss Alice’s hair that peculiar shade, and her eyes
that heavenly blue, over which my staid sister Dora waxed
so eloquent. Miss Alice is an ex-Governor’s great grand
daughter—but go on, mother, only come to Alice herself
and give her <em>figure</em> as soon as may be.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do you mean?” asked Anna, who took things
literally. “I should suppose you’d care more for her face
than her form.”</p>

<p class='c011'>John smiled mischievously, while his mother continued.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I fancy that Mrs. Johnson’s family met with a reverse
of fortune before her marriage, but know nothing certainly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>except that she was greatly beloved in Boston. Her
husband has been dead some years, and recently she has
bought and fitted up that pretty cottage down by the river.
I do not see her as often as I would like to, for I am greatly
pleased with her, although she has some habits of which
I cannot approve, such as associating with the poor of the
town to the extent she does. Why, I hear that Alice had
a party the other day consisting wholly of ragged urchins.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They were her Sunday school scholars,” interposed
Anna. “Alice has picked up a large class of children, who
before her coming, used to run the streets on Sundays
breaking up birds’ nests and pilfering gardens. I am sure
we ought to be much obliged to her, for our fruit and
flowers are now comparatively safe.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I vote that Anna goes on with Alice’s history. She
gives it best,” said John, and so Anna continued,</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is but little to tell. Mrs. Johnson and her
daughter are both nice ladies, and I am sure you will like
them—every body does; and rumor has already given
Alice to our young clergyman, Mr. Howard.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And she is worth fifty thousand dollars, too,” rejoined
Asenath, as if that were a powerful reason why a poor
clergyman should not aspire to her hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have her <em>figure</em> at last,” said John, winking slily at
Anna, who only looked bewildered. And, the $50,000
did seem to make an impression on the young man, who
made numerous inquiries concerning the heiress, asking
how often she came to Terrace Hill, and where he would
be most likely to see her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“At church,” was Anna’s reply. “She is always there
and their pew joins ours.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Dr. Richards did not much like going to church, unless
it were where the music was grand and operatic. Still
he had intended honoring the benighted Snowdonites with
a sight of himself for one half day, though he knew he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>should be terribly bored; but now the case was different,
for besides being, to a certain extent, a kind of <em>lion</em>, he
should see Miss Alice, and he reflected with considerable
satisfaction that as this was Friday night, only one day
intervened ere his curiosity and that of the villagers would
be gratified. He was glad there was something new and
interesting in Snowdon in the shape of a pretty girl, for he
did not care to return at once to New York, where he had
intended practising his profession. There were too many
sad memories clustering about that city to make it altogether
desirable, but Dr. Richards was not yet a hardened
wretch, and thoughts of another than Alice Johnson,
crowded upon his mind as on that first evening of his return,
he sat answering questions and asking others of his own.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was late ere the family group broke up, and the
storm beating so furiously upon Spring Bank, was just
making its voice heard round Terrace Hill Mansion, when
the doctor took the lamp the servant brought, and bidding
his mother and sisters good night, ascended the
stairs whither Anna, who kept early hours, had gone before
him. She was not, however, in bed, and when she
heard his step passing her door she called softly to him,</p>

<p class='c011'>“John, brother John, come in a moment, please.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER V.<br> <span class='large'>ANNA AND JOHN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>He found her in a tasteful dressing gown, its heavy tassels
almost sweeping the floor, while her long glossy hair
loosened from its confinement of ribbon and comb, covered
her neck and shoulders as she sat before the fire always
kindled in her room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How picturesque you look,” he said gaily, bending his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>knees in mock homage before her. Then seating himself
upon the sofa at her side, he wound his arm around her
and waited for her to speak.</p>

<p class='c011'>“John,” and Anna’s voice was soft and pleading, “tell
me more of that young girl. Did you love her very
much?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Love her! yes,” and John spoke excitedly while the
flush deepened on his cheek when Anna continued, “why
didn’t you marry her then?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why didn’t I? yes, why didn’t I?” and John started
to his feet; then resuming his seat again he continued,
“why didn’t <em>you</em> marry that <em>Missionary</em> who used to
be here so much? Anna, I tell you there’s a heap of
wrong for somebody to answer for, but it is not you, and
it is not me—it’s—it’s mother!” and John whispered
the word, as if fearful lest the proud, overbearing woman
should hear.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are mistaken,” Anna replied, “for as far as Charlie
was concerned father had more to do with it than
mother. He objected to Charlie because he was poor—because
he was a missionary—because he was not an
Episcopalian, and because he loved me. He turned Charlie
from the house—he locked me in my room, lest I
should get out to meet him, and from that window I
watched him going from my sight. I’ve never seen him
since, though I wrote to him once or twice, bidding him
forget me and marry some one else. He did marry
another, but I’ve never quite believed that he forgot me.
I know, though, that as Hattie’s husband he would do
right and be true to her, for he was good, and when I was
with him I was better; but I’ve forgotten most all he
taught me, and the way he pointed out so clearly seems
dark and hard to find, but I shall find it—yes, Charlie, I
shall find it out at last, so we may meet in Heaven.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna was talking more to herself than to John, and
Charlie, could he have seen her, would have said she was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>not far from the narrow way which leadeth unto life. To
John her white face, irradiated with gleams of the soft
firelight, was as the face of an angel, and for a time he
kept silence before her, then suddenly exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Anna, you are good, and so was she, and that made
it hard to leave her, to give her up. Anna do you know
what my mother wrote me? Listen, while I tell, then
see if she is not to blame. She cruelly reminded me that
by my father’s will all of us, save you, were wholly dependent
upon her, and said the moment I threw myself
away upon a low, vulgar, penniless girl, that moment she
cast me off, and I might earn my bread and hers as best I
could. She said, too, my sisters, Anna and all, sanctioned
what she wrote, and your opinion had more weight than
all the rest.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, John, mother could not have so misconstrued my
words. I said I thought it would be best for you not to
marry her, unless you were too far committed; at least
you might wait awhile, and when you started for Europe
so abruptly, I thought you had concluded to wait and see
how absence would affect you. Surely my note explained—I
sent one in mother’s letter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It never reached me,” John said bitterly, while Anna
sighed at this proof of her mother’s treachery.</p>

<p class='c011'>Always conciliatory, however, she soon remarked,</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are sole male heir to the Richards name. Mother’s
heart and pride are bound up in you. She wishes
you to make a brilliant match, such as she is sure you
can, and if she has erred, it was from her love to you and
her wish for your success. A poor, unknown girl would
only add to our expenses, and not help you in the least,
so it’s for the best that you left her, though I’m sorry for
the girl. Did she suffer much? What was her name?
I’ve never heard.”</p>

<p class='c011'>John hesitated a moment and then answered, “I called
her Lily, she was so fair and pure.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Anna was never in the least suspicious, or on the watch
for quibbles, but took all things for granted, so now she
thought within herself, “Lillian, most likely. What a
sweet name it is.” Then she said aloud. “You were
not engaged to her outright, were you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>John started forward and gazed into his sister’s face
with an expression as if he wished she would question
him more closely, for confession to such as she might ease
his burdened conscience, but Anna never dreamed of a
secret, and seeing him hesitate, she said,</p>

<p class='c011'>“You need not tell me unless you like. I only thought
maybe, you and Lilly were not engaged.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We were;” and rising to his feet John leaned his
forehead upon the marble mantel, which cooled its feverish
throbbings. “Anna, I’m a wretch—a miserable
wretch, and have scarcely known an hour’s peace since I
left her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Was there a scene?” Anna asked; and John replied,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Worse than that. Worse for her. She did not know
I was going till I was gone. I wrote to her from Paris,
for I could not meet her face and tell her how mean I
was. I’ve thought of her so much, and when I landed in
New York I went at once to find her, or at least to inquire,
hoping she’d forgotten me. The beldame who
kept the place was not the same with whom I had left
Lily, but she knew about her, and told me she died with
cholera last September. She and—oh, Lily, Lily——”
and hiding his face in Anna’s lap, John Richards sobbed
like a little child.</p>

<p class='c011'>Had Anna been possessed of ordinary penetration, she
would have guessed that behind all this there was something
yet untold, but she had literally no penetration at
all. In her nature there was no deceit, and she never
suspected it in others, until it became too palpable not to
be seen. Very caressingly her white hand smoothed the
daintily perfumed hair resting on her dress, and her own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>tears mingled with her wayward brother’s as she thought,
“His burden is greater than mine. I will help him bear
it if I can.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“John,” she said at last, when the sobbing had ceased,
“I do not think you so much to blame as others, and you
must not reproach yourself so bitterly. You say Lily
was good. Do you mean she was a Christian, like Charlie?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, if there ever was one. Why, she used to make
a villain like me kneel with her every night, and say the
Lord’s Prayer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>For an instant, a puzzling thought crossed Anna’s brain
as to the circumstances which could have brought her
brother every night to Lily’s side, but it passed away immediately
as she rejoined,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then she is safe in Heaven, and there are no tears
there; no broken hearts, or weary hours of watching.
We’ll try to meet her some day. You did right to seek
her out. You could not help her dying. She might
have died had she been your wife, so, I’d try to think it
happened for the best, and you’ll soon get to believing it
did. That’s my experience. You are young yet, only
twenty-six, and life has much in store for you. You’ll
find some one to fill Lily’s place; some one whom we
shall all think worthy of you, and we’ll be so happy together.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Doctor did not reply to this but sat as if lost in
painful thought, until he heard the clock strike the hour
of midnight.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I did not think it was so late,” he exclaimed. “I must
really leave you now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna would not keep him longer, and with a kiss she
sent him away, herself holding the door a little ajar to
see what effect the new carpet would have upon him. It
did not have any at first, so much was he absorbed in
thinking of <em>Lily</em>, but he noticed it at last, admiring its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>pattern and having a pleasant consciousness that every
thing in his room was in keeping, from the handsome
drapery which shaded the windows to the marble hearth
on which a fire was blazing. He could afford to have a
fire, and he sat enjoying it, thinking far different thoughts
from Hugh Worthington, who, in his scantily furnished
room, sat, with a curl of golden hair upon the stand beside
him, and a well worn Bible in his hand. Dr. Richards
had no Bible of his own; he did not read it now—had
never read it much, but somehow his talk with Anna
had carried him back to the time when just to please his
Lily he had said with her the Lord’s Prayer, kneeling at
her side with his arm around her girlish form. He had
not said it since, and he never would again, he thought.
It was sheer nonsense, asking not to be led into temptation,
as if God delighted to lead us there. It was just fit
for weak women to believe, though now that Lily was
dead and gone he was glad that she had believed it, and
he felt that she was better off for having said those prayers
and acted up to what she said. “Poor Lily,” he kept
repeating to himself, while in his dreams that night there
were visions of a lonely grave in a secluded part of Greenwood,
and he heard again the startling words,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dead, both she and the child.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He did not know there was a child, and he staggered
in his sleep, just as he staggered down the creaking stairs,
repeating to himself,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lily’s child—Lily’s child! May Lily’s God forgive
me!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER VI.<br> <span class='large'>ALICE JOHNSON.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Sunday anticipated by Dr. Richards as the one
which was to bless him with a sight of Snowdon’s belle,
dawned at last, a clear, cold, winter morning, when the air
was full of frost, and the crispy snow creaked beneath the
tread, and glittered like diamonds in the sunshine. The
Doctor had not yet made his appearance in the village, for
a hoarseness, to which he was subject, had confined him
at home, and Saturday had been spent by him in rehearsing
to his sisters and the servants the things he had seen
abroad, and in wondering if Alice Johnson would meet
his expectations. He did not believe her face would at all
compare with the one which continually haunted his
dreams, and over which the coffin-lid was shut weary
months ago, but $50,000 had invested Miss Alice with
that peculiar charm which will sometimes make an ugly
face beautiful. The Doctor was beginning to feel the need
of funds, and now that <em>Lily</em> was dead, the thought had
more than once crossed his mind that to set himself to the
task of finding a wealthy wife was a duty he owed himself
and his family. Had poor, deserted Lily lived, he
could not tell what he might have done, for the memory
of her love was the one restraining influence which kept
him from much sin. He never could forget her; never
love another as he had once loved her, but she was dead
and he was free to do his mother’s will. Similar to these
were the Doctor’s cogitations, as, on that Sunday morning,
he made his toilet for church, anticipating not a little satisfaction
from the sensation he was sure to create among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>some of the worshippers at St. Paul’s, for he remembered
that the Terrace Hill gentry had always been people of
much importance to a certain class of Snowdonites.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna was not with the party which at the usual hour
entered the family carriage with Bibles and prayer-books
in hand. She seldom went out except on warm, pleasant
days; but she stood in the deep bay window watching
the carriage as it wound down the hill and thinking, how
handsome and stylish her young brother looked with his
Parisian cloak and cap, which he wore so gracefully.
Others than Anna thought so too; and at the church
door there was quite a little stir, as he gallantly handed
out first his mother and then his sisters, and followed
them into the church.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dr. Richards had never enjoyed a reputation for being
very devotional, and the interval between his entrance
and the commencement of the service was passed by him
in a rather scornful survey of the timeworn house, which
had not improved during his absence. With a sneer in
his heart, he mentally compared the old-fashioned pulpit,
with its steep flight of steps and faded trimmings, with
the lofty cathedral he had been in the habit of attending
in Paris, and a feeling of disgust and contempt for people
who could be satisfied with a town like Snowdon, and a
church like St. Paul’s, was creeping over him, when a soft
rustling of silk and a consciousness of a delicate perfume,
which he at once recognized as aristocratic, warned him
that somebody was coming; somebody entirely different
from the score of females who had distributed themselves
within range of his vision, their countrified bonnets, as he
termed them, trimmed outside and in without the least
regard to taste, or combination of color. But the little
lady, moving so quietly up the aisle, her full skirt of dark
blue silk trailing as she came, her handsome cloth cloak,
falling so gracefully from the sloping shoulders, which the
fur of Russian sable fitted so well, her plain, but fashionable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>hat tied beneath her chin, with broad, rich ribbon,
the color of her dress, her dainty little muff, and,
more than all, the tiny glove, fitting, without a wrinkle, the
little hand which tried the pew door twice ere it yielded
to her touch; she was different. She was worthy of
respect, and the Paris beau felt an inclination to rise at
once and acknowledge her superior presence.</p>

<p class='c011'>Wholly unconscious of the interest she was exciting,
the lady deposited her muff upon the cushions, and then
kneeling reverently upon the well worn stool, covered
her face with the hands which had so won the doctor’s
admiration. What a little creature she was, and how gloriously
beautiful were the curls of indescribable hue, falling
in such profusion from beneath the jaunty hat. All
this Dr. Richards noted, marvelling that she knelt so long,
and wondering what she could be saying. His mother
and sisters did the same, it is true, but he always imagined
it was merely to be fashionable; but in the attitude
of this kneeler at his side there was something which
precluded mockery. Was she sincere? Was there one
hearing what she said—an ear which marked the faintest
sigh and caught the weakest tone? He wished he knew;
and a pang, keen as the cut of a dissector’s knife, shot
through his heart, as he remembered another maiden, almost
as fair as this one, kneeling at her prayers. <em>Lily</em>
had believed in Alice Johnson’s God, and he was glad
that she had so believed, for without God, poor Lily’s short,
sad life had been worse than vain!</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice’s devotions ended at last, and the view so coveted
was obtained; for in adjusting her dress Alice turned
toward him, or rather toward his mother, and the doctor
drew a sudden breath as he met the brilliant flashing of
those laughing sunny blue eyes, and caught the radiant
expression of that face, slightly dimpled with a smile.
Beautiful, wondrously beautiful was Alice Johnson, and
yet the features were not wholly regular, for the piquant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>nose had a slight turn up, and the forehead was not very
high; but for all this, the glossy hair, the dancing blue
eyes, the apple-blossom complexion, and the rose-bud
mouth made ample amend; and Dr. Richards saw no fault
in that witching face, flashing its blue eyes for an instant
upon him, and then modestly turning to the service just
commencing. But few of the sacred words, we fear, took
deep root in the doctor’s heart that morning. He could
scarcely have told the day, certainly not the text, and when
the benediction was pronounced he was astonished that
what he had dreaded as prosy and long had proved to be
so short.</p>

<p class='c011'>As if divining his wishes in the matter, his mother, after
waiting a moment, till Alice arose from her knees, offered
her hand to the young girl, inquired kindly for Mrs.
Johnson, expressed extreme concern when told of a heavy
cold, suggested one or two remedies, commented upon
the weather, spoke of Mr. Howard’s sermon, and then, as
if all the while this had not been the chief object in stopping,
she turned to the eagerly expectant doctor, whom
she introduced as “My son, Dr. Richards.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With a smile which he felt even to his finger tips, Alice
offered him her hand, welcoming him home, and making
some trivial remark touching the contrast between their
quiet town and the cities he had left.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But you will help make it pleasanter for us this winter,
I am sure,” she continued, and the sweet blue eyes sought
his for an answer as to whether he would desert Snowdon
immediately.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” he replied, he should probably remain at home
some time, he always found it pleasant at Snowdon
though as a boy he had often chafed at its dullness; but it
could not now be dull, with the acquisition it had received
since he was there before; and he bowed toward the
young lady, who acknowledged the compliment with a
faint blush and then turned toward the group of noisy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>“ill-bred children,” as Dr. Richards thought, who came
thronging about her, one offering a penny lest it should
be forgotten, a second whispering that Tommie couldn’t
come because he had no shoes, while a third climbed upon
the seat for the kiss, which was promptly given, the
giver all unconscious of the disgust felt by the foreign
gentleman, who had a strong desire to take the kissed by
the neck and thrust him out into the snow! What affinity
was there between that sparkling, beautiful girl, and
that pack of vulgar young ones, he’d like to know?
What was she to them, or they to her, that they should
cling to her so confidingly?</p>

<p class='c011'>“My Sunday School scholars; I have a large class, you
see,” Alice said, as if in answer to these mental queries.
“Ah, here comes my youngest—” and Alice stooped to
caress a little rosy cheeked boy, with bright brown eyes
and patches on both coat sleeves.</p>

<p class='c011'>The doctor saw the patches, and with a gesture of impatience,
turned to go, just as his ear caught another kiss,
and he knew the patched boy received what he would
have given much to have.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hanged if I don’t half wish I was one of those ragged
urchins,” he said, after handing his mother and sisters to
their carriage, and seating himself at their side. “But
does not Miss Johnson display strange taste. Surely some
other one less refined might be found to look after those
brats, if they must be looked after, which I greatly doubt.
Better leave them as you find them; can’t elevate them
if you try. It’s trouble thrown away,” and John Richards
wrapped his Parisian cloak closer around him, and leaning
back in his corner, wondered if Alice Johnson really was
happy in her teaching, or did she do it for effect.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is like what Lily would have done,” he thought, “had
she possessed the power and means. Alice and Lily must
be alike,” and with a mental wish that Alice’s fate might
prove a happier one than poor Lily’s had been, John relapsed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>into a silent mood, such as usually came over him
when Lily was in his mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>That afternoon, while his mother and elder sisters were
taking their usual Sunday nap, and Anna was nodding in
her chair, the Doctor sat watching the blazing fire and
trying to decide upon his future course.</p>

<p class='c011'>Should he return to New York, accept the offer of an
old friend of his father’s, an experienced practitioner, and
earn his own bread honorably; or, should he remain at
Snowdon and cultivate Alice Johnson? John wanted
money sadly; the whole family wanted money, as every
hour of his stay among them proved. They were growing
poor so fast; and it showed plainly, in spite of their
attempts to conceal it. John would almost as soon be
dead as be poor. He never had denied himself; he never
could, he said, though well he knew the time was coming
when he must, unless, to use Micawber’s expression, “something
should turn up.” And hadn’t it turned up in the
shape of a beautiful heiress? What was to hinder him
from entering the lists and carrying off the prize? He
had never yet failed when he chose to exert himself, and
though he might, for a time, be compelled to adopt a different
code of morality from that which he at present acknowledged,
he would do it for once. He could be interested
in those ragged children; he could encourage Sunday
schools; he could attend church as regularly as Alice
herself and, better yet, he could doctor the poor for nothing,
as that was sure to tell, and he would do it, too, if
necessary. This was the finale which he reached at last by
a series of arguments pro and con, and when it was reached,
he was anxious to commence the task at once. He
presumed he could love Alice Johnson; she was so pretty,
but even if he didn’t, he would only be doing what thousands
had done before him. He should be very proud of
her, and would certainly try to make her happy. One
long, almost sobbing sigh to the memory of poor Lily,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>who had loved so much and been so cruelly betrayed, one
faint struggle with conscience, which said that Alice Johnson
was too pure a gem for him to trifle with, and then
the past, with its sad memories, was buried. Lily’s sweet
pleading face, asking that no other one should be wronged
as she had been, was thrust aside, and Dr. Richards stood
ready for his new career.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER VII<br> <span class='large'>RIVERSIDE COTTAGE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Johnson did not like Dr. Richards when she came
to know him, and yet he was an almost daily visitor at
Riverside Cottage, where one face at least grew brighter
when he came, and one pair of eyes beamed on him a welcome.
His new code of morality worked admirably, and
as weeks passed away he showed no signs of weariness
in the course he had adopted. Mr. Howard himself was
not more regular at church, or Alice more devout, than
Dr. Richards. The children, whom he had denominated
“ragged brats,” were no longer spurned with contempt,
but fed instead with pea-nuts and molasses candy, the doctor
going frequently into the by-lanes where they lived,
and where they began to expect him almost as much as
Alice. He was popular with the children, but the parents,
clearer sighted, treated him most shabbily at his back, accusing
him of caring only for Miss Alice’s good opinion,
and of being at heart a most consummate knave!</p>

<p class='c011'>This was what the poor said, and what many others
thought. It could not be that John Richards, whom they
had known from boyhood as proud, selfish, and overbearing,
could so suddenly change his entire nature, becoming
at once so amiable, so familiar, so generous, so much, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>short, like Alice herself. As well might the leopard change
its spots, and many were the insinuations thrown darkly
at Alice, who smiled at them all and thought how little
Dr. Richards was understood.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the winter passed away and spring advanced, he
showed no intentions of leaving Snowdon, but on the
contrary opened an office in the village, greatly to the surprise
of the inhabitants, and greatly to the dismay of old
Dr. Rogers, who for years had blistered and bled the good
people without a fear of rivalry.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Does Dr. Richards intend locating permanently in
Snowdon?” Mrs. Johnson asked of her daughter as they
sat alone one evening.</p>

<p class='c011'>“His sign would indicate as much,” was Alice’s reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a faint sigh in the direction of the sofa, on
which Mrs. Johnson, who for several days had been suffering
from a severe pain in her head, was lying, and the
sigh smote painfully on Alice’s ear, for well she guessed
its import.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mother,” she said gently, as leaving her chair she
came and knelt by her mother’s side, “you look pale and
worried, as if something ailed you more than your head.
You have looked so for some time past. What is it,
mother? Are you very sick, or——” and Alice hesitated,
“are you troubled about me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is there any reason why I should be troubled about
my darling?” asked the mother, smoothing fondly the
bright curls almost touching her face.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice never had any secrets from her mother, and she
answered frankly, “I don’t know, unless—unless—mother,
why don’t you like Dr. Richards?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The ice was fairly broken now, and very briefly but
candidly Mrs. Johnson told why she did not like him.
He was handsome, refined, educated and agreeable, she
admitted, but there was something lacking. The mask
he was wearing had not deceived her, and she would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>have liked him far better without it. This she said to
Alice, adding gently, “He may be all he seems, but I doubt
it. I distrust him greatly. I think he fancies you and
loves your money.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, mother, you do him injustice, and he has been so
kind to us, while Snowdon is so much pleasanter since he
came.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you engaged to him?” was Mrs. Johnson’s next
question.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” and Alice looked up wonderingly. “I do not
like him well enough for that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice Johnson was wholly ingenuous and would not for
the world have concealed a thing from her mother, and
very frankly she continued,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I like Dr. Richards better than any gentleman I have
ever met, and it seems to me that people here do him injustice,
but I may be mistaken. I know he is unpopular,
and that first made me sorry for him. I am sure he
is pleased with me, but he has never asked me to be his
wife. I should have told you, mother,” and the beautiful
eyes which had so charmed the doctor, looked up confidingly
at the pale face bending over them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“God bless my darling, and keep her as innocent as
now,” Mrs. Johnson murmured, bowing her head upon
her daughter’s, and kissing the rosy cheek. “I am glad
there is no engagement. Will you promise there shall
not be for one year at least?”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a hard thing to ask, for more than she guessed,
till then, did Alice’s heart incline toward Dr. Richards.
Slily, adroitly, he had insinuated himself into her affections,
boasting that he could sway her at will, only let him
attend the Lenten services, week days and all, drop something
in the plate every Sabbath, speak to all the ragamuffins
he met, take old Mrs. Snyder out for an airing every
week, and he was all right with Alice Johnson. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>this was the man from whom Mrs. Johnson would save
her daughter, asking again for the promise.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I will, I do,” Alice said at last.</p>

<p class='c011'>A second “God bless my darling,” came from the mother’s
lips, and drawing her treasure nearer to her, she continued,
“You have made me very happy, and by and by
you’ll be so glad. You may leave me now, for I am tired
and faint.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was long ere Alice forgot the expression of her mother’s
face or the sound of her voice, as she bade her good
night on that last evening they ever spent together alone.
The indisposition of which Mrs. Johnson had been complaining
for several days, proved to be no light matter,
and when next morning Dr. Rogers was summoned to her
bedside, he decided it to be a fever which was then prevailing
to some extent in the neighboring towns.</p>

<p class='c011'>That afternoon it was told at Terrace Hill that Mrs.
Johnson was very sick, and half an hour later the Richards
carriage, containing the doctor and his sister Anna,
wound down the hill, and passing through the park, turned
in the direction of the cottage, where they found Mrs.
Johnson worse than they had anticipated. The sight of
distress roused Anna at once, and forgetting her own feebleness
she kindly offered to stay until night if she could
be of any service. Mrs. Johnson was fond of Anna, and
she expressed her pleasure so eagerly that Anna decided
to remain, and went with Alice to remove her wrappings.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I forgot!” she exclaimed, as a sudden thought
seemed to strike her. “I don’t know as I can stay after
all, though I might write it here, I suppose, as well as at
home; and as John is going to New York to-night he will
take it along.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is it?” Alice asked; and Anna replied,</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’ll think me very foolish, no doubt; they all do,
especially John, and have tried to laugh me out of it, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>I have thought about it, and dreamed about it, until it is
impressed upon me that I must do it, and I had decided
to attend to it this very day, when we heard of your
mother’s illness, and John persuaded me to come here
with him, as he wished to say good-bye to you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll get you writing materials if you like,” Alice said,
“or you can go at once to the library. Your brother will
wait, I am sure.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; but I want to know if you too think me foolish.
I’m so dependent on others’ opinions;” and, in a low tone,
Anna told how long she had been wanting some nice
young person to be constantly with her as companion or
waiting-maid, and of the advertisement seen early last
winter, how queerly it was expressed, and how careless
John had been in tearing off the name and address, with
which to light his cigar. “It seems to me,” she continued,
“that ‘unfortunate married woman’ is the very one
I want. I cannot account for the interest I feel in her,
and in spite of all my family can say, I’ve concluded to
write, and let John take it to the <cite>Herald</cite>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; but how will you find her? I understand that
the address was burned,” Alice rejoined quickly, feeling
herself that Anna was hardly sane in her calculations.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I’ve fixed that in the wording,” Anna answered.
“I do not know as it will ever reach her, it’s been so long,
but if it does, she’ll be sure to know I mean her, or somebody
like her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not at all clear to Alice, but she made no objections,
and taking her silence as a tacit approval of her
project, Anna followed her to the library.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I dislike writing very much,” she said, as she saw
the array of materials, “and I write so illegibly too. Please
do it for me, that’s a dear, good girl,” and she gave the
pen to Alice, who wrote the first word, “Wanted,” and
then waited for Anna to dictate.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>“<span class='sc'>Wanted.</span>—By an invalid lady, whose home is in
the country, a young woman, who will be both useful
and agreeable, either as a companion or waiting-maid.
No objection will be raised if the woman is married, and
unfortunate, or has a child a few months old.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Address,</div>
      <div class='line in16'>“A. E. R., Snowdon, Hampden Co., Mass”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“That is what will assure her, should she ever see it,”
Anna said, pointing to the lines,——</p>

<p class='c011'>“No objection raised if the young woman is married
and unfortunate, or has a child a few months old.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice thought it the queerest advertisement she had
ever seen, but Anna was privileged to do queer things,
and folding the paper, she went out into the hall, where
the doctor sat waiting for her. Handing him the note,
she was about to explain its import, when Anna joined
her, and explained herself, charging him to attend to it
the very first thing.</p>

<p class='c011'>John’s mustached lip curled a little scornfully as he
read it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, puss, that girl or woman is in Georgia by this
time, and as the result of this, Terrace Hill will be thronged
with unfortunate women and children, desiring situations.
They’ll stand three deep from the park gate to the
house. Better let me burn this, as I did the other, and
not be foolish. She will never see it,” and John made a
gesture as if he would put it in the stove, but Anna caught
his hand, saying imploringly, “Please humor me this once.
She may see it, and I’m so interested.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna was always humored, and so the doctor placed
in his memorandum book the note, then turning to Alice
he addressed her in so low a tone that Anna readily took
the hint and left them together. Dr. Richards was not
intending to be gone long, he said, though the time
would seem a little eternity, so much was his heart now
bound up in Snowdon.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>Afraid lest he might say something more of the same
nature, Alice hastened to ask if he had seen her mother
and what he thought of her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I stepped in for a moment while you were in the
library,” he replied. “She seemed to have a high fever,
and I fancied it increased while I stood by her. I am
sorry to leave while she is so sick, but remember that if
anything happens you will be dearer to me than ever,”
and the doctor pressed the little hand which he took in
his to say good-bye, for now he must really go.</p>

<p class='c011'>With a swelling heart Alice watched him as he left
the house, and then running to her own room locked the
door and throwing herself upon the bed sobbed bitterly.
What did his words, “if anything happens” imply? Did
he think her mother so very sick? Was she going to
die? “Oh, mother, mother! I will not let her go!” was
the cry of a heart which at first rebelled against the
threatened blow, refusing to receive it. Anon, however,
better, calmer thoughts succeeded, and though Alice could
not yet say “Thy will be done,” she was not so rebellious,
and a pleading prayer went up, “Spare, oh, spare my mother,”
while hope whispered that this terrible calamity would
not happen to her.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the day and night wore on Mrs. Johnson grew worse
so rapidly that at her request a telegram was forwarded
to Mr. Liston, who had charge of her moneyed affairs,
and who came at once, for the kind old man was deeply
interested in the widow and her lovely daughter. As
Mrs. Johnson could bear it, they talked alone together
until he perfectly understood what her wishes were with
regard to Alice, and how to deal with Dr. Richards.
Then promising to return again in case the worst should
happen, he took his leave, while Mrs. Johnson, now that a
weight was lifted from her mind, seemed to rally, and the
physician pronounced her better. But with that strange
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>foreknowledge, which sometimes comes to people whose
days are nearly numbered, she felt that she would die, and
that in mercy this interval of rest and freedom from pain
was granted her, in which she might talk with Alice concerning
the arrangements for the future.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alice, darling,” she said, when they were alone, “come
sit by me here on the bed and listen to what I say.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice obeyed, and taking her mother’s hot hand in hers
she waited for what was to come.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alice, darling, are you willing to be left alone for a
little while? It won’t be long, and our Father in Heaven
knows best what is for our good.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, mother, don’t; you will not die,” and Alice sobbed
convulsively. “Last night, when I thought you were in
danger, I prayed so hard to be willing, but I couldn’t, oh,
I couldn’t, and God seemed a great ways off—seemed as
if he did not hear. In all the wide world I can never find
another mother, and I shall be so desolate.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Johnson knew just how desolate her dying would
leave her child, for she had felt the same, and for a few
moments she strove to comfort the weeping girl, who hid
her face in the pillows, by telling her of One who will
surely care for the orphan; for he has said he would, and
his word never fails.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have learned to trust him in prosperity, and He
will be a thousand fold nearer to you in adversity. You’ll
miss me, I know, and be very lonely without me, but you
are young, and life has many charms for you, besides God
will never forget or forsake his covenant children.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Gradually as she talked the sobbing ceased, and when
the white face lifted itself from its hiding place there was
a look upon it as if the needed strength had been sought
and to some extent imparted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My will was made some time ago,” Mrs. Johnson continued,
“and that with a few exceptions, such as legacies
to your nurse Densie Densmore, and some charitable institutions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>you are my sole heir. Mr. Liston is to be your
guardian, and will look after your interests until you are
of age, or longer if you choose. You know that as both
your father and myself were only children, you have no
near relatives on either side to whom you can look for
protection. There is a kind of second cousin, it is true,
the old gentleman who visited us just before we came
here. But his family are gay, fashionable people, and
I’d rather you should not go there, even if he were
willing. Mr. Liston would give you a home with him,
but I do not think that best and there is but one other
alternative.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will remember having heard me speak occasionally
of a friend now living in Kentucky, a Mrs. Worthington
whose husband was a distant relative of ours.
Ralph Worthington and your father were school boys together,
and afterward college companions. They were
more like brothers than friends; indeed, they were often
likened to David and Jonathan, so strongly were they attached
to each other.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was but sixteen when I became a bride, and, as you
know, several years elapsed ere God blessed me with a living
child. Your father was consumptive, and the chances
were that I should early be left a widow. This it was, I
think, which led to the agreement made by the two friends
to the effect that if either died the living one should care
for the widow and fatherless as for a brother’s family. To
see the two as they pledged themselves to keep this solemn
compact, you would not have guessed that the tall,
athletic, broad chested Ralph, would be the first to go, yet
so it was. He died ere you were born.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then <em>he</em> is dead? Oh, I’m so sorry,” Alice exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, he’s dead; and, as far as possible, your father fulfilled
his promise to Ralph’s widow and her child—a little
boy, five years old, of whom Mrs. Worthington herself
was appointed guardian. I never knew what spirit of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>evil possessed Eliza who had been my schoolmate and
to whom I was greatly attached; but in less than a year
after her husband’s death, she made a second and most unfortunate
marriage. We both opposed it, for we distrusted
the man. As the result of our opposition, a coolness
sprang up between us, and we saw but little of each other
after that. Mr. Murdoch proved a greater scoundrel that
we supposed, and when their little girl was nearly two
years old, we heard of a divorce. Mr. Johnson’s health
was failing fast, and we were about to make the tour of
Europe, in hopes a change would benefit him. Just before
we sailed we visited poor Eliza, whom we found doubly
heart-broken, for, in addition to the other outrages heaped
upon her, the brutal wretch had managed to steal her
beautiful daughter, and carried it no one knew whither.
I never shall forget the distress of the brother. I’ve often
thought of him since, and wondered what he had grown
to be. We comforted Eliza as best we could, and left
money to be used for her in case she needed it. Then we
embarked with you and Densie for Europe. You know
how for a while, your father seemed to regain his strength,
how he at last grew worse and hastened home to die.
In the sorrow and excitement which followed, it is not
strange that Eliza was for a time forgotten, and when I remembered
and enquired for her again, I heard that Hugh
had been adopted by some relation in Kentucky, that the
stolen child had been mysteriously returned, and was living
with its mother in Elmswood—a quiet, out-of-the-way
town, which I never visited until that summer when you
went West with the Gilmores.</p>

<p class='c011'>“At first Eliza appeared a little cool, but this soon
wore off, and was mostly owing, I fancy, to the mortification
she felt at my finding her in circumstances so changed
from what they used to be, for, though managing to keep
up a genteel exterior, she was really very poor. She did
not talk much of Hugh. Indeed, she knew but little of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>him, as his letters were far apart, and only contained praises
of his horses, his dogs, and the rare sport he had in hunting
with his eccentric uncle, whose name I have forgotten.
Neither did she say much of Adaline, who was then away
at school. Still my visit was a sadly satisfactory one, as
we recalled old times when we were girls together weeping
over our great loss when our husbands were laid to
rest. Then we spoke of their friendship, and lastly of the
contract.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘It sounds preposterous in me, I know,’ Mrs. Worthington
said, when we parted, ‘you are so rich and I so
poor, but if ever Alice should want a mother’s care, I will
gladly give it to her.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“This was nearly eight years ago. And, as I failed to
write her for a long, long time, while she was long in answering,
the correspondence ceased till just before her
removal to Kentucky, when she apprised me of the change.
You have now the history of Mrs. Worthington, the only
person who comes to mind as one to whose care I can
entrust you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, mother, I may not be wanted there,” and Alice’s
lip quivered painfully. “Adaline is a young lady now,
and Hugh, what of him, mother? What is he?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Johnson could not tell; neither did she know if
her darling would be welcome, but money, she knew, had
a charm, and she replied to Alice’s queries,</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will not go empty handed, nor be a burden to
them. They are poor, and money will not come amiss.
We can but try at all events, and if they object, Mr. Liston
will do the best he can for you. For some weeks, it
has been impressed upon me that my time was short, and
fancying it could do no harm, I have written to Mrs.
Worthington a letter which you will send when I am
gone. I have asked her to receive you, to care for you
as her own. I said that Mr. Liston would attend to all
pecuniary matters, paying your allowance quarterly; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>I am sure you will not object when I tell you that I think
it right to leave Adaline the sum of one thousand dollars.
It will not materially lessen your inheritance, and it will
do her a world of good. Mr. Liston will arrange it for
you. You will remain here until you hear from Mrs.
Worthington, and then abide by her arrangements. She
is a gentle, affectionate woman, and will be kind to you.
I do not know that she is a Christian, but your influence
may do her good, and make her bless the day when you
were sent to her. Will you go, my daughter—go cheerfully?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, mother, I’ll go,” came gaspingly from Alice’s lips,
“I’ll go but, mother, oh, mother,” and Alice’s cry ended as it
always did, “you will not, you must not die!”</p>

<p class='c011'>But neither tears, nor prayers could avail to keep the
mother longer. Her work on earth was done, and after
this conversation she grew worse so rapidly that hope
died out of Alice’s heart, and she knew that soon she
would be motherless. There were days and nights of
pain and delirium in which the sick woman recognized
none of those around her save Alice, whom she continually
blessed as her darling, praying that God, too, would bless
and keep his covenant child. At last there came a change,
and one lovely Sunday morning, when the sunlight lay
upon the springing grass and sparkled on the river, when
the air was laden with the early flowers’ perfume, and birds
were singing by the door, the delirium passed away, and
in the room so long kept dark and still, were heard whispered
words of joy, of peace, of perfect rest, such as the
dying Christian only feels. It was early morning then
and ere the bell from St. Paul’s tower sent forth its summons
to the house of God, there rang from its belfry a
solemn toll, and the villagers listening to it, said, as they
counted forty-four, that Mrs. Johnson was dead.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER VIII.<br> <span class='large'>MR. LISTON AND THE DOCTOR.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Among Snowdon’s poor that day, as well as among the
wealthier class, there was many an aching heart, and many
a prayer was breathed for the stricken Alice, not less beloved
than the mother had been. At Terrace Hill Mansion,
much sorrow was expressed, and among the older sisters
a considerable anxiety felt as to whether this sudden death
would postpone indefinitely the marriage they had looked
upon as sure to take place between their brother and the
youthful heiress. They hoped not, for money was greatly
needed at Terrace Hill. In the familiar intercourse
which latterly had existed between themselves and Alice
they had seen enough to know how generous and free she
was. Once their sister, and Terrace Hill would blossom
again as the rose. On the whole it was very unfortunate
that Mrs. Johnson should have died so unexpectedly, and
they did wish John was there to comfort the young girl
who, they heard, refused to see any one except the clergyman
and Mr. Liston.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Suppose we telegraph for John,” Eudora said, and in
less than two hours thereafter, Dr. Richards in New York
read that Alice was an orphan.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a pang as he thought of her distress, a wish
that he were with her, and then the thought arose, “What
if she does not prove as wealthy as I have supposed. Will
that make any difference?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He knew it would, for though more interested in Alice
than he supposed he could be in any one after poor Lily
died, he was far too mercenary to let his affections run
away with his judgment, and could the stricken Alice have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>looked into his heart and seen what his cogitations were
that morning, when at the St. Nicholas he sat thinking,
how her mother’s loss might possibly affect him, she would
have shrunk from him in horror. He had best go home
at once, he said, and on the day appointed for the funeral
he reached the station adjoining Snowdon, where he
alighted, as the Express train did not stop in the next town.
It was not more than two miles to Terrace Hill across the
fields, and as he preferred walking to riding, he sauntered
slowly on, thinking of Alice and wishing he did know just
the amount left her by her mother.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must do something,” he soliloquized, “or how can I
ever pay those debts in New York, of which mother
knows nothing? I wish that widow——”</p>

<p class='c011'>He did not finish his wishes, for a turn in the path
brought him suddenly face to face with Mr. Liston, whom
he had seen at a distance, and whom he recognized at
once.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll quiz the old codger,” he thought. “He don’t, of
course, know me, and will never suspect my object.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mistaken doctor! The old codger was fully prepared.
He did know Dr. Richards by sight, and was rather glad
than otherwise when the elegant dandy, taking a seat
upon the gnarled roots of the tree under which he was
sitting, made some trivial remark about the weather, which
was very propitious for the crowd who were sure to attend
Mrs. Johnson’s funeral.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yes, Mr. Liston presumed there would be a crowd. It
was very natural there should be, particularly as the deceased
was greatly beloved and was also reputed wealthy.
“It beats all what a difference it makes, even after death,
whether one is supposed to be rich or poor,” and the <em>codger</em>
worked away industriously at the pine stick he was whittling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But in this case the supposition of riches must be correct,
though I know people are oftener over valued than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>otherwise,” and with his gold-headed cane the doctor
thrust at a dandelion growing near.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing truer than that,” returned the whittler, brushing
the litter from his lap. “Now I’ve no doubt that prig
of a doctor, who they say is shining up to Alice, will be
disappointed when he finds just how much she’s worth.
Let me see. What is his name? Lives up there,” and
with his jack-knife Mr. Liston pointed toward Terrace
Hill.</p>

<p class='c011'>Smothering his desire to throttle and then pitch into
the river the old man, calling him a <em>a prig of a doctor</em>, so
coolly and deliberately marring his golden visions, the
doctor answered, naturally,</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Richards family live there, sir. You mean their
son, I presume.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, the chap that has travelled and come home so
changed. They do say he’s actually taken to visiting all
the rheumatic old women in town, applying sticking plasters
to their backs and administering <em>squills</em> to their children,
all free gratis. Don’t ask a red—does it for charity’s
sake: but I know he expects to get his pay out of
Alice’s purse, as he does it to please her and nothing else.
He ought to be rewarded for all his philanthropy with a
rich wife, that’s a fact. It’s too bad to have him so disappointed,
and if he comes out to the funeral I believe I’ll
tell him as a friend that my advice is, not to marry for
money—it won’t pay,” and from beneath the slouched
hat drawn so closely over the comical face, the keen gray
eyes looked curiously.</p>

<p class='c011'>Poor doctor! How he fidgeted, moving so often that
his tormenter demurely asked him if he were sitting on a
<em>thistle</em>!</p>

<p class='c011'>“Does Miss Johnson remain here?” the doctor asked
at last, and Mr. Liston replied by telling what he knew
of the arrangements.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the mention of Worthington the doctor, looked up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>quickly. Whom had he known by that name, or where
had he heard it before? “Mrs. Worthington, Mrs. Worthington,”
he repeated, unpleasant memories of something,
he knew not what, rising to his mind. “Is she living in
this vicinity?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In Kentucky. It’s a widow and her daughter,” Mr.
Liston answered, wisely resolving to say nothing of a
young man, lest the doctor should feel anxious.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A widow and her daughter! I must be mistaken in
thinking I ever knew any one by that name, though it
seems familiar,” said the doctor, and as by this time he
had heard all he wished to hear, he arose, and bidding Mr.
Liston good morning walked away in no enviable frame
of mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I didn’t tell him a lie. He will be disappointed when
he finds just how much she is worth, and my advice to
him, or any other man, is not to marry for money,” Mr.
Liston chucklingly soliloquized as he watched the crestfallen
doctor disappearing from view, muttering to himself,
“The wretch! to talk so to my face! I wish I’d knocked
him down. Rheumatic woman and squills, indeed! But
it’s all true, every word, and that’s the worst of it. I have
turned fool just to get a pretty girl, or rather to get her
money. But I won’t stay here to be laughed at. I’ll go
back this very day. I am glad no one has seen me except
that old rat, who never guessed I was the chap he complimented
so highly, the rascal!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Looking at his watch the doctor found that it lacked
several hours ere the express from Boston was due. But
this did not discourage him. He would stay in the fields
or anywhere, and turning backward he followed the course
of the river winding under the hill until he reached the
friendly woods which shielded him from observation.
How he hated himself hiding there among the trees, and
how he longed for the downward train, which came at last,
and when the village bell tolled out its summons to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>house of mourning, he sat in a corner of the car returning
to New York even faster than he had come.</p>

<hr class='c014'>

<p class='c011'>Gradually the Riverside cottage filled with people assembling
to pay the last tribute of respect to the deceased,
who during her short stay among them had endeared herself
to many hearts.</p>

<p class='c011'>Slowly, sadly, they bore her to the grave. Reverently
they laid her down to rest, and from the carriage window
Alice’s white face looked wistfully out as “earth to earth,
ashes to ashes,” broke the solemn stillness. Oh, how she
longed to lay there too, beside her mother! How the sunshine,
flecking the bright June grass with gleams of gold,
seemed to mock her misery as the gravelly earth rattled
heavily down upon the coffin lid, and she knew they were
covering up her mother. “If I too could die!” she murmured,
sinking back in the carriage corner and covering
her face with her veil. But not so easily could life be shaken
off by her, the young and strong. She must live yet
longer. She had a work to do—a work whose import
she knew not; and the mother’s death, for which she then
could see no reason, though she knew well that one existed,
was the entrance to that work. She must live and
she must listen while Mr. Liston talked to her that night
on business, arranging about the letter, which was forwarded
immediately to Kentucky, and advising her what to do
until an answer was received.</p>

<p class='c011'>Not a word did he say of his interview with the doctor,
nor did Alice know he had been there. She would not
have cared if she had, so crushed and desolate was her
young heart, and after Mr. Liston was gone and the house
had become quiet again, a species of apathy settled upon
her as with a feeling akin to despair she sat down to wait
for the news from Kentucky, which was to decide her future
course.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER IX.<br> <span class='large'>MATTERS IN KENTUCKY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Backward now with our reader we turn, and take up
the broken thread of our story at the point where we left
Adah Hastings, sleeping, in that best chamber at Spring
Bank; while around the timeworn building the winter wind
howled dismally, and drove the sleet in gusts against the
windows. There were piles of snow next morning upon
the steps, huge drifts against the doors, and banks against
the fences, while the bent-up negroes shivered and drew
back from the cutting blast, so foreign to their temperaments.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a bitter morning in which to face the fierce north
wind, and plow one’s way to the Derby cornfield, where
in a small, dilapidated building, Aunt Eunice Reynolds,
widowed sister of John Stanley, had lived for many years,
first as a pensioner upon her brothers bounty, and next as
Hugh’s incumbent. At the time of her brother’s death
Aunt Eunice had intended removing to Spring Bank, but
when Hugh’s mother wrote, asking for a home, she abandoned
the plan, and for two seasons more lived alone,
watching from her lonely door the tasselled corn ripening
in the August sun. It was strange that a house should
have been built there in the center of that cornfield, with
woods enclosing it on every side save one, and stranger
still, that Aunt Eunice should care to stay there, year
after year, as she did. But she preferred it, she said “to
having a paltry, lazy nigger under foot,” and so her brother
suffered her to have her way, while the neighbors marvelled
at and admired the untiring energy and careful
neatness which made the cottage in the corn field so cozy-like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>and cheerful. Hugh was Aunt Eunice’s idol, the
object which kept her old heart warm and young with
human love. For him she would endure any want or encounter
any difficulty, and in his dilemma regarding Adah
Hastings, he intuitively turned to her, as the one who
would lend a helping hand. He had not been to see her
in two days, and when the grey December morning broke
and he looked out upon the deep, untrodden snow, he
frowned impatiently, as he thought how bad the path
must be between Spring Bank and the cornfield, whither
he intended going, as he would be the first to tell what
had occurred. ’Lina’s fierce opposition to, and his mother’s
apparent shrinking from Adah, had convinced him how
hopeless was the idea that she could stay at Spring Bank
with any degree of comfort to herself or quiet to him.
Aunt Eunice’s house was the only refuge for Adah, and
there she would be comparatively safe from censorious
remarks.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Inasmuch as ye did it to the least of these ye did it
unto me,” kept ringing in Hugh’s ears, as he hastily dressed
himself, striking his benumbed fingers together, and
trying hard to keep his teeth from chattering, for Hugh
was beginning his work of economy, and when at daylight
Claib came as usual to build his master’s fire, he had
sent him back, saying he did not need one, and bidding
him go, instead, to Mrs. Hastings’ chamber.</p>

<p class='c011'>It took more than a shake or two that morning ere
Hugh’s toilet was completed, for the stiff, heavy boots refused
at first to go on, but with a kick and a jerk, and
what would have been an oath if he had not thought of
Golden Hair in time to prevent its utterance, Hugh prevailed
at last and the refractory boots came to their proper
place. Bounding down the stairs he hurried out to the
kitchen, where only a few of his negroes were stirring.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ho, Claib!” he called, “saddle Rocket quick and bring
him to the door. I’m going to the corn field.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>“Lor’ bless you, mas’r, it’s done snow higher than Rocket’s
head. He’ll never stand it nohow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do as I bid you,” was Hugh’s reply, and indolent
Claib went shivering to the stable where Hugh’s best
horses were kept.</p>

<p class='c011'>A whinnying sound of welcome greeted him as he entered,
but was soon succeeded by a spirited snort as he attempted
to lead out a most beautiful dapple gray, Hugh’s
favorite steed, his pet of pets, and the horse most admired
and coveted in all the country.</p>

<p class='c011'>“None of yer <em>ars</em>,” Claib said coaxingly, as the animal
threw up his neck defiantly, “You’ve got to get along
’case Mas’r Hugh say so. You know Mas’r Hugh.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As if he really knew and understood, the proud head
came down at once, and Rocket suffered himself to be led
from the stall, but when the keen north wind struck full
upon his face, the gleaming eyes flashed with stubborn
fire, and planting his feet firmly in the snow, Rocket resisted
all Claib’s efforts to get him any further. Scolding
did no good, coax him he could not, strike him he dared
not, and alternately changing the halter from hand to hand
poor Claib blew his stiffened fingers and called lustily for
help.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is it?” Hugh asked, coming out upon the stoop,
and comprehending the trouble at a glance. “Rocket
Rocket,” he cried, “Easy, my boy,” and in an instant Rocket’s
defiant attitude changed to one of perfect obedience.</p>

<p class='c011'>He knew and loved the voice calling so cheerily to him,
and with a sudden plunge, which wrenched his halter from
Claib’s grasp and sent the poor negro headlong into the
snow, he bounded to his master’s side. Rubbing his head
against Hugh’s shoulder, he suffered himself to be caressed
for a moment, and then, playful as a kitten, gambolled
around him in circles, sometimes making a feint of coming
near to him, and again leaping backward with the peculiarly
graceful motion for which he was so famous. How
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Hugh loved that noble animal, and how Rocket loved him,
licking his hands whenever he entered the stable, and crying
piteously after him when he left. Five hundred dollars
had been offered him for that horse, but though wanting
money sadly, he had promptly refused the offer, determined
that Rocket should know no master save himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There, my beauty,” he said, as the animal continued
to prance around him. “There, you’ve showed off enough.
Come, now, I’ve work for you to do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Docile as a lamb when Hugh commanded, he stood quietly
while Claib equipped him for his morning’s task.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell mother I shan’t be back to breakfast,” Hugh said,
as he sprang into the saddle, and giving loose rein to
Rocket went galloping through the snow.</p>

<p class='c011'>Under ordinary circumstances that early ride would have
been vastly exhilarating to Hugh, who enjoyed the bracing
air, but there was too much now upon his mind to admit
of his enjoying any thing. Thoughts of Adah, and the
increased expense her presence would necessarily bring,
flitted across his mind, while Harney’s bill, put over once,
and due again ere long, sat like a nightmare on him, for
he saw no way in which to meet it. No way save one,
and Rocket surely must have felt the throbbing of Hugh’s
heart as that one way flashed upon him, for he gave a
kind of coaxing whine, and dashed on over the billowy
drifts faster than before.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Rocket, no,” and Hugh patted his neck. He’d
never part with Rocket, He’d sell Spring Bank first with
all its incumbrances.</p>

<p class='c011'>The cornfield was reached by this time, and with a single
bound Rocket cleared the gate at the entrance. A six-rail
fence was nothing for him to leap, and like a deer he
sped across the field, and ere long stood before Aunt Eunice’s
door. It was now three days since Hugh had gladdened
Aunt Eunice’s cottage with the sunshine of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>presence, and when she awoke that morning, and saw
how high the snow was piled around her door, she said to
herself, “The boy’ll be here directly to know if I’m
alive,” and this accounted for the round deal table drawn
before the blazing fire, and looking so inviting with its
two plates and cups, one a fanciful china affair, sacredly
kept for Hugh, whose coffee always tasted better when
sipped from its gilded side. The lightest of egg bread was
steaming on the hearth, the tenderest of steak was broiling
on the griddle, while the odor of the coffee boiling on
the coals came tantalizingly to Hugh’s olfactories as Aunt
Eunice opened the door, saying pleasantly,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I told ’em so. I felt it in my bones, and the breakfast
is all but ready. Put Rocket up directly, and come in to
the fire.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Fastening Rocket in his accustomed place in the outer
shed, Hugh stamped the snow from his heavy boots, and
then went in to Aunt Eunice’s kitchen-parlor, as she called
it, where the tempting breakfast stood upon the table.
Nimble as a girl Aunt Eunice brought his chair, and
placing it in the warmest part of the room, the one next
to the wall and farthest from the door where the wind
and snow crept in. But Hugh was not selfish enough to
keep it, and he made Aunt Eunice change, for he knew
the blood moved more slowly through her veins than his.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No coffee! What new freak is that?” and Aunt Eunice
gazed at him in astonishment as he declined the cup
she had prepared with so much care, dropping in the
whitest lumps of sugar, and stirring in the thickest cream.</p>

<p class='c011'>It cost Hugh a terrible struggle to refuse that cup of
coffee, but if he would retrench, he must begin at once
and determining to meet it unflinchingly he replied that
“he had concluded to drink water for a while, and see
what that would do; much was said nowadays about
coffee’s being injurious, and he presumed it was.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In great distress the good old lady asked if “his dyspeptic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>was out of order,” still insisting that he should take
the cup, whose delicious odor well nigh overcame resolution.
But Hugh was firm as a granite rock when once
his mind was settled, and assuring Aunt Eunice that his
“dyspeptic” was right, he betook himself to the gourd,
standing in the pail of water within his reach. Poor
Aunt Eunice did not half enjoy her breakfast, and she
would not have enjoyed it at all had she known that
Hugh was abstaining from what he loved so much only
that she and others might be fed and warmed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There’s something on your mind,” she said, observing
his abstraction. “Have you had another dunning letter,
or what?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Aunt Eunice had made a commencement, and in his
usual impulsive way Hugh told the story of Adah and
then asked if she would take her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, Hugh,” and Aunt Eunice spoke earnestly, “you
cannot afford the expense. Think twice before you commit
yourself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have thought twice, the last time just as I did the
first. Adah shall stay. You need some one these winter
nights. There’s the room you call mine. Give her that.
Will you, Aunt Eunice?” and Hugh wound his arm
around Aunt Eunice’s ample waist, while he pleaded for
Adah Hastings.</p>

<p class='c011'>Aunt Eunice was soon won over as Hugh knew she
would be, and it was settled that she should come that
very day if possible.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look, the sky is clearing,” and he pointed to the sunshine
streaming through the window.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We’ll have her room fixed before I go,” and with his
own hands Hugh split and prepared the wood which was
to kindle Adah’s fire, then with Aunt Eunice’s help sundry
changes were made in the arrangement of the rather meagre
furniture, which never seemed so meagre to Hugh as
when he looked at it with Adah’s eyes and wondered how
she’d like it.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>“Oh, I wish I were rich,” he sighed mentally, and taking
out his well worn purse he carefully counted its contents.</p>

<p class='c011'>Twenty-five dollars. That was all, and this he had been
so long in saving for the new coat he meant to buy. Hugh
would like to dress better if he could, and was even anticipating
his sister’s surprise when he should appear
before her some day habited in a coat of the latest style.
To do this Adah’s room must go unfurnished yet awhile
and with another sigh the purse was returned to his pocket,
just as Aunt Eunice, who had stepped out for a moment,
reappeared, bringing a counterpane and towel, one
of which was spread upon the bed, while the other covered
the old pine stand, marred and stained with ink and
tallow, the result of Hugh’s own carelessness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a heap of difference that table cloth and pocket-handkerchief
do make,” was Hugh’s man-like remark, his
face brightening with the improved appearance of things
and his big heart growing warm with the thought that he
might keep his twenty-five dollars and Adah be comfortable
still.</p>

<p class='c011'>With a merry laugh Aunt Eunice explained that the
<em>table cloth</em> was a <em>bed-spread</em>, and the <em>handkerchief</em> a <em>towel</em>.
It was all the same to Hugh so long as they improved the
room, and glancing at his watch, he said it was time to be
gone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Ad</em> may pick Adah’s eyes out before I get home,” was
his laughing remark as he vaulted into his saddle and
dashed off across the fields, where, beneath the warm
Kentucky sun, the snow was already beginning to soften.</p>

<p class='c011'>Breakfast had been late at Spring Bank that morning,
for the strangers had required some care, and Miss ’Lina
was sipping her coffee rather ill-naturedly when a note
was handed her, and instantly her mood was changed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Splendid, mother!” she exclaimed, glancing at the tiny,
three-cornered thing; “an invitation to Ellen Tiffton’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>party. I was afraid she would leave me out after Hugh’s
refusal to attend the Ladies’ fair, or buy a ticket for her lottery.
It was only ten dollars either, and Mr. Harney
spent all of forty, I’m sure, in the course of the evening.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hugh had no ten dollars to spare,” Mrs. Worthington
said, apologetically, “though, of course, he might
have been more civil than to tell Ellen it was a regular
swindle, and the getters-up ought to be indicted. I almost
wonder at her inviting him, as she said she’d never
speak to him again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Invited him! Who said she had? It’s only one card
for me,” and with a most satisfied expression ’Lina presented
the note to her mother, whose face flushed at the
insult offered her son—an insult which even ’Lina felt,
but would not acknowledge, lest it should interfere with
her going. “There may be some mistake,” she suggested.
“Lulu may have dropped his,” and ringing the bell she
summoned to their presence a bright, handsome mulatto
girl, who answered frankly that</p>

<p class='c011'>“Only one invite was given her, and, and that for Miss
’Lina. I asked Jake,” she said, “where was Master
Hugh’s, and he said, ‘Oh. Miss Ellen’s ravin’ at him;
called him no gentleman; and wouldn’t invite him any
way.’ I think it’s right mean in her, for Master Hugh is
enough sight better gentleman than Bob Harney, that
she’s after. I told Jake to tell her so,” and having thus
vindicated her master’s cause, Lulu tripped back to the
kitchen, leaving her mistress and ’Lina to finish their
party discussion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You won’t go, of course,” Mrs. Worthington said,
quietly. “You’ll resent her slighting Hugh.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed I shan’t,” the young lady retorted. “I hardly
think it fair in Ellen, but I shall accept, and I must go to
town to-day to see about having my pink silk fixed. I
think I’ll have some black lace festooned round the skirt.
How I wish I could have a new one. Do you suppose
Hugh has any money?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>“None for new dresses or lace flounces either,” Mrs.
Worthington replied. “I fancy he begins to look old and
worn with this perpetual call for money from us. We
must economize.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never mind, when I get Bob Harney I’ll pay off old
scores,” ’Lina said, laughingly, as she arose from the table
and went to look over her wardrobe, having first investigated
the weather, and ascertained, from a consultation
with Cæsar, that the roads would undoubtedly be passable
by noon.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meantime Hugh had returned, meeting in the kitchen
with Lulu, who worshipping her young master with a
species of adoration, resented any insults offered him far
more keenly than his own sister did.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, Lu, what is it? What’s happened?” Hugh
asked, as he saw she was full of some important matter.</p>

<p class='c011'>In an instant the impetuous Lulu told him of the party
to which he was not invited, together with the reason
why, and the word she had sent back.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll give ’em a piece of my mind!” she said, as she saw
Hugh change color. “She may have old Harney. He’s
jes good enough for her! The hateful! His man John,
told Claib how his master said he meant to get me and
Rocket, too, some day; me for her waiting-maid, I reckon.
You won’t sell me, Master Hugh, will you?” and Lulu’s
eyes looked pleadingly up to Hugh.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never!” and Hugh’s riding whip came down upon
the table with a force which made Lulu start.</p>

<p class='c011'>Satisfied that she was safe from Ellen Tiffton’s whims,
Lulu darted away, while Hugh entered the sitting-room,
where ’Lina sat, surrounded by her party finery, and prepared
to do the amiable to the utmost.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That really is a handsome little boy upstairs,” she said,
as if she supposed it were her mother who came in; then
an affected start she added, “Oh, it’s you! I thought
’twas mother. Don’t you think, Ellen has not invited you.
Mean, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>“Ellen can do as she likes,” Hugh replied, adding, as he
guessed the meaning of all that finery, “You surely are
not going?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why not?” and ’Lina’s black eyes flashed full upon
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I thought perhaps you would decline for my sake,” he
replied.</p>

<p class='c011'>An angry retort trembled on ’Lina’s lip, but she had an
object to attain, so she restrained herself and answered
that “she had thought of it, but such a course would do
no good, and she wanted to go so much, the Tifftons were
so exclusive and aristocratic.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hugh whistled contemptuously, but ’Lina kept her temper,
and continued, coaxingly,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Everybody is to be there, and you’d like to have your
sister look decent, I know; and really, Hugh, I can’t unless
you give me a little money. Do, Hugh, be good for
once.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ad, I can’t,” and Hugh spoke sorrowfully, for a kind
word from ’Lina always touched his weaker side. “I
would if I could, but honestly I’ve only twenty-five dollars
in the world, and I’ve thought of a new coat. I don’t like
to look so shabby. It hurts me worse than it does you,”
and Hugh’s voice trembled as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c011'>Any but a heart of stone would have yielded, but, ’Lina
was too supremely selfish. Hugh had twenty-five dollars.
He might give her half, or even ten. She’d be satisfied
with ten. He could soon make that up. The negro hire
came due ere long. He must have forgotten that.</p>

<p class='c011'>No, he had not; but with the negro hire came debts,
thoughts of which gave him the old worn look his mother
had observed. Only ten dollars! It did seem hard to
refuse, and if ’Lina went, Hugh wished her to look well,
for underneath his apparent harshness lurked a kind of
pride in his sister, whose beauty was of the bold, dashing
style.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>“Take them,” he said at last counting out the ten with
regretful sigh. “Make them go as far as you can, and Ad,
remember don’t get into debt.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I won’t,” and with a civil “Thank you,” ’Lina rolled
up her bills, while Hugh repaired to Adah’s room telling
her of Aunt Eunice, and his plan of taking her there.</p>

<p class='c011'>With a burst of tears, Adah listened to him, and then
insisted upon going away, as she had done the previous
night. She had no claim on him, and she could not be a
burden.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You, madam, think it best, I’m sure,” she said, appealing
to Mrs. Worthington, who was present and who answered
promptly,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not. I am willing you should remain until your
friends are found.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Adah offered no further remonstrance, but turning to
Hugh, said hesitatingly,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I may hear from my advertisement. Do you take the
<cite>Herald</cite>?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, though I can’t say I think much of it,” Hugh replied,
and Adah continued,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then if you ever find anything for me, you’ll tell me,
and I can go away,” I said, “Direct to Adah Hastings.
Somebody will be sure to see it. Maybe <em>George</em>, and
then he’ll know of Willie.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With a muttered invective against the “villain,” Hugh
left the room to see that the carriage was ready, while his
mother, following him into the hall, offered to go herself
with Adah if he liked. Glad to be relieved, as he had
business that afternoon in Versailles, and was anxious to
set off as soon as possible, Hugh accepted at once, and
half an hour later, the Spring Bank carriage, containing
Mrs. Worthington, Adah and Willie, drove slowly from
the door, ’Lina calling after her mother to send Cæsar
back immediately, as she was going to Frankfort after dinner,
and wanted the carriage herself.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER X.<br> <span class='large'>’LINA’S PURCHASE AND HUGH’S</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>There were piles of handsome dress goods upon the
counter at <em>Harney’s</em> that afternoon, and <em>Harney</em> was anxious
to sell. It was not often that he favored a customer
with his own personal services, and ’Lina felt proportionably
flattered when he came forward and asked what he
could show her. “Of course, a dress for the party—he
had sold at least a dozen that day, but fortunately he still
had the most, elegant pattern of all, and he knew it would
exactly suit her complexion and style. There would be
nothing like it at the party, unless she wore it, as he
hoped she would, for he knew how admirably she would
become it, and he’d had her in his mind all the time.”
’Lina was easily flattered, while the silk was beautiful,
and as she thought how well the soft tinted rose with its
single white velvety leaf, standing out so full and rich,
would become her dark hair and eyes, an intense desire
came over her to possess it. But ten dollars was all she
had, and turning away from the tempting silk she answered
faintly, that “it was superb, but she could not
afford it, besides, she had not the money to-day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not the slightest consequence,” was Harney’s quick
rejoinder, as he thought of Hugh’s already heavy bill, and
alas, thought of Rocket too! “Not the slightest consequence.
Your brother’s credit is good, and I’m sure he’ll
be proud to see you in it. I should, were <em>I</em> your brother.”</p>

<p class='c011'>’Lina blushed, while the wish to possess the silk grew
every moment stronger.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If it were <em>only fifty dollars</em>, it would not seem so bad,”
she thought. Hugh could manage it some way, and Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Harney was so good natured; he could wait a year, she
knew. But the making would cost ten dollars more, for
that was the price Miss Allis charged, to say nothing of
the trimmings. “No, I can’t,” she said, quite decidedly at
last, asking for the lace with which she at first intended
renovating her old pink silk. “She must see Miss Allis
first to know how much she wanted,” and she tripped over
to Frankfort’s fashionable dressmaker, whom she found
surrounded with dresses for the party.</p>

<p class='c011'>Such an array and such elegance too; the old pink faded
into nothing. She should be quite in the shade, and
feeling much like crying, ’Lina sat watching the nimble
fingers around her, and waiting for Miss Allis’ advice, when
a new idea crossed her mind. She heard Adah say that
morning when she was in her room, that she could sew
neatly, that she always made her own dresses, and if hers,
why not ’Lina’s! She certainly looked as if she might
have good taste, and she ought to do something by way
of remuneration; besides that, if Adah made it, she could,
from her mother’s budgets pick up enough for linings,
whereas nothing but new entire would answer the purpose
of a fashionable artiste, like Miss Diana Allis. ’Lina was
fast persuading herself to buy the coveted silk, and as
some time would elapse ere Miss Allis could attend to her
she went back to Harney’s just for one more look at the
lovely fabric. It was, if possible, more beautiful than before,
and Harney was more polite, while the result of the
whole was that, when ’Lina at four o’clock that afternoon
entered her carriage to go home, the despised pink silk,
still unpaid on Harney’s books, was thrown down any
where, while in her hands she carefully held the bundle
Harney brought himself, complimenting her upon the
sensation she was sure to create, and inviting her to dance
the first set with him. Then with a smiling bow he closed
the door upon her, and returning to his books wrote
down Hugh Worthington his debtor to fifty dollars more.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>“That makes three hundred and fifty,” he said to himself.
“I know he can’t raise that amount of ready money,
and as he is too infernal proud to be sued, I’m sure of
Rocket or Lulu, it matters but little which,” and with a
look upon his face which made it positively hideous, the
scheming Harney closed his books, and sat down to calculate
the best means of managing the rather unmanageable
Hugh!</p>

<p class='c011'>It was dark when ’Lina reached home, but the silk looked
well by firelight, and ’Lina would have been quite
happy but for her mother’s reproaches and an occasional
twinge as she thought of Hugh who had not yet returned,
and whose purchase that afternoon was widely different
from her own.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the day when a number of negroes, whose master
had failed to a large amount, were to be sold in the
Court House, and Hugh, as he reined up a moment before
it, saw them grouped together upon the steps. He had
no fancy for such scenes, but the eager, wistful glances
the wretched creatures cast upon the passers by awoke
his sympathy, and after finishing his business he returned
to the Court House just as the auctioneer was detailing the
many virtues of the bright-looking lad first upon the
block. There was no trouble in disposing of them all,
save a white-haired old man, whom they called Uncle
Sam, and who was rather famous for having been stolen
from his late master and sold into Virginia. With tottering
steps the old man took his place, while his dim eyes
wandered over the faces congregated around him as if seeking
for their owner. But none was found who cared for
Uncle Sam. He was too old—his work was done, and
like a worn out horse he must be turned off to die.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Won’t nobody bid for <em>Sam</em>? I fotched a thousand
dollars onct,” and the feeble voice trembled as it asked
this question.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What will become of him if he is not sold?” Hugh
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>asked of a bystander, who replied, “Go back to the old
place to be kicked and cuffed by the minions of the new
proprietor, <em>Harney</em>. You know Harney, of Frankfort?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Yes, Hugh did know Harney as one who was constantly
adding to his already large possessions houses and lands
and negroes without limit, caring little that they came to
him laden with the widow’s curse and the orphan’s tears.
The law was on his side. He did nothing illegally, and so
there was no redress. This was Harney, and Hugh always
felt exasperated when he thought of him. Advancing
a step or two he came nearer to the negro, who
took comfort at once from the expression of his face, and
stretching out his shaking hand he said beseechingly,</p>

<p class='c011'>“You, mas’r, you buy old Sam ’case it ’ill be lonesome
and cold in de cabin at home when they all is gone. Please
mas’r,” and the tone was so pleading, that Hugh felt a
great throb of pity for the desolate, forsaken negro.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How old are you?” he asked, taking the quivering
hand still extended toward him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bless you, mas’r, longer than I can ’member. They
was allus puttin’ me back and back to make me young,
till I couldn’t go backuds no more, so I spec’s I’s mighty
nigh a thousan’,” was the negro’s reply, whereupon cheers
for Uncle Sam resounded long and loud among the
amused spectators.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What can you do?” was Hugh’s next query, to
which the truthful negro answered,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothin’ much, or, yes,” and an expression of reverence
and awe stole over the wrinkled face, as in a low tone he
added, “I can pray for young mas’r, and I will, only buy
me, please.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hugh had not much faith in praying negroes, but something
in old Sam struck him as sincere. His prayers
might do good, and he needed somebody’s, sadly. But
what should he offer, when fifteen dollars was all he had
in the world, and was it his duty to encumber himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>with a piece of useless property? Visions of the Golden
Haired and Adah both rose up before him. They would
say it was right. They would tell him to buy old Sam,
and that settled the point.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Five dollars,” he called out, and Sam’s “God bless
you,” was sounding in his ears, when a voice from another
part of the building doubled the bid, and with a moan
Uncle Sam turned imploringly toward Hugh.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A leetle more, mas’r, an’ you fotches ’em; a leetle
more,” he whispered, coaxingly, and Hugh faltered out
“Twelve.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thirteen,” came from the corner, and Hugh caught
sight of the bidder, a sour-grained fellow, whose wife had
ten young children, and so could find use for Sam.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thirteen and a half,” cried Hugh.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fourteen,” responded his opponent.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Leetle more, mas’r, berry leetle,” whispered Uncle
Sam.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fourteen and a quarter,” said Hugh, the perspiration
starting out about his lips, as he thought how fast his pile
was diminishing, and that he could not go beyond it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fourteen and a half,” from the corner.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Leetle more, mas’r,” from Uncle Sam.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fourteen, seventy-five,” from Hugh.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fifteen,” from the man in the corner, and Hugh
groaned aloud,</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s every dime I’ve got.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Quick as thought an acquaintance beside him slipped
a bill into his hand, whispering as he did so,</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s a V. I’ll double it if necessary. I’m sorry for
the darky.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was very exciting now, each bidder raising a quarter
each time, while Sam’s “a leetle more, mas’r,” and the vociferous
cheers of the croud, whenever Hugh’s voice was
heard, showed him to be the popular party.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nineteen, seventy-five,” from the corner, and Hugh
felt his courage giving way as he faintly called out,</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>“Twenty.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Only an instant did the auctioneer wait, and then his
decisive, “Gone!” made Hugh the owner of Uncle Sam,
who crouching down before him, blessed him with tears
and prayers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I knows you’re good,” he said; “I knows it by yer
face; and mebby, when the rheumatics gits out of my ole
legs I kin work for mas’r a heap. Does you live fur from
here?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Three miles or more,” Hugh replied, bidding the negro
follow him.</p>

<p class='c011'>The snow was melting, but out upon the turnpike it was
still so deep that Hugh had many misgivings as to the old
man’s ability to walk, but Sam, intent on proving that he
was smarter than he seemed, declared himself perfectly
competent to go with “Mars’r” to the world’s end, if necessary.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s mighty cold, though,” he said, as he emerged into
the open air, and the chilly wind penetrated the thin rags
which covered him. “It’s mighty cold, and my knees is
all a shakin’, but I’ll git over it bimeby.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not in Hugh’s nature to see the old man shiver
so, and taking off his own thick shawl he wrapped it round
the negro’s shoulders, saying to the bystanders,</p>

<p class='c011'>“My blood is warmer than his.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Another cheer from the crowd, another, “God bless you,
mas’r,” and the strange pair started on their homeward
tour, Hugh riding very slowly, and accommodating Rocket’s
steps to the hobbling old man, who wheezed and puffed,
and sweat with the wondrous efforts he made, and at
last when only a mile was gone, gave out entirely, and
pitched headlong into the snow.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s my dumb knees. They allus was crooked and shaky,”
he gasped, becoming more and more entangled in the
shawl, which he was not accustomed to wearing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look here, Sam,” and Hugh laughed heartily at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>negro’s forlorn appearance, as, regaining his feet, he assumed
a most deprecating attitude, asking pardon for tumbling
down, and charging it all to his shaky knees. “Look
here, there’s no other way, except for you to ride and me
to walk. Rocket won’t carry double,” and ere Sam could
remonstrate, Hugh had dismounted and placed him in the
saddle.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rocket did not fancy the exchange, as was manifest by
an indignant snort, and an attempt to shake Sam off, but
a word from Hugh quieted him, and the latter offered the
reins to Sam, who was never a skillful horseman, and felt
a mortal terror of the high-mettled steed beneath him.
With a most frightened expression upon his face, he grasped
the saddle pommel with both hands, and bending nearly
double, gasped out,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sam ain’t much use’t to gemman’s horses. Kind of
hold me on, mas’r, till I gits de hang of de critter. He
hists me round mightily.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So, leading Rocket with one hand, and steadying Sam
with the other, Hugh got on but slowly, and ’Lina had
looked for him many times ere she spied him from the
window as he came up the lawn.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In the name of wonder, what is that on Rocket!” she
exclaimed, as she caught sight of Sam, whose rags were
fluttering in the wind. “An old white-headed nigger, as I
live!” and she hastened to the door, where the servants
were assembling, all curious like herself to see the new arrival.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very carefully Hugh assisted him to dismount, but
Sam’s knees, cramped up so long on Rocket, refused to
straighten at once, and Lulu was not far out of the way
when she likened him to a toad, while her mischievous
brother Jim called out,</p>

<p class='c011'>“How d’ye, old bow legs?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Jest tol’able, thankee,” was Sam’s meek reply, then
spying ’Lina he lifted his hat politely, bowing so low that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>his knees gave out again, and he would have fallen had
not Hugh held him up.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who is he, and what did you get him for?” Mrs.
Worthington asked, as Hugh led him into the dining
room.</p>

<p class='c011'>Briefly Hugh explained to her why he had bought the
negro.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was foolish, I suppose, but I’m not sorry yet,” he
added, glancing toward the corner, where the poor old
man was sitting, warming his shriveled hands by the
cheerful fire, and muttering to himself blessings on
“young mas’r.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Supper had been delayed for Hugh, and as he took his
seat at the table, he inquired after Adah.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pretty well when I left,” said his mother, adding that
Lulu had been there since, and reported her as looking
pale and worn, while Aunt Eunice seemed worried with
Willie, who was inclined to be fretful.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They need some one,” Hugh said. “Can’t you spare
Lulu?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Worthington did not know, but ’Lina, to whom
Lulu was a kind of waiting-maid, took the matter up, and
said,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed they couldn’t. There was no one at Spring
Bank more useful, and it was preposterous for Hugh to
think of giving their best servant to Adah Hastings. Let
her take care of her baby herself. She guessed it wouldn’t
hurt her. Any way, they couldn’t afford to keep a servant
for her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With a long drawn sigh, Hugh finished his supper, and
was about lighting his cigar when he felt some one touching
him, and turning round he saw that Sam had grasped
his coat. The negro had heard the conversation, and
drawn correct conclusions. His new master was not rich.
He could not afford to buy him, and having bought him
could not afford to keep him. There was a sigh in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>old man’s heart, as he thought how useless he was, but
when he heard about the baby, his spirits rose at once.
In all the world there was nothing so precious to Sam as
a little white child, with waxen hands to pat his old black
face, and his work was found.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mas’r,” he whispered, “Sam kin take keer that baby.
He knows how, and the little childrens in Georgy, whar I
comed from, used to be mighty fond of Sam. I’ll tend to
the young lady too. May I, Mas’r?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Sam did not look much like Hugh’s ideas of a child’s
nurse or a ladie’s waiting-maid, but necessity knows no
choice, and thinking the old man might answer for Willie
until something better offered, he replied,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps you may. I will see to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, stepping to the door he called Claib, and bidding
him show Sam where he was to sleep, repaired himself
to his own cold chamber which seemed doubly comfortless
and dreary from its contrast with the warm pleasant
sitting-room where the selfish ’Lina, delighted at his absence,
was again admiring the handsome silk, which Adah
was to make.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XI.<br> <span class='large'>SAM AND ADAH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>With heavy eyes and aching head Adah worked day
after day upon the dress, which ’Lina had coaxed her to
make, saying both to her and Aunt Eunice that, as she
wished to surprise Hugh with a sight of herself in full array,
they were not to tell him that the dress was new, but
suffer him to think it the old pink silk which she was fixing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hardly suppose he’d know the difference,” she said,
“but if you can arrange it not to work when he is here, I
wish you would.”</p>

<p class='c011'>’Lina could be very gracious when she chose, and as
she saw a way by which Adah might be useful to her, she
chose to be so now, and treated the unsuspecting girl so
kindly, that Adah promised to undertake the task, which
proved a harder one than she had anticipated. Anxious
to gratify ’Lina, and keep what she was doing a secret
from Hugh, who came to the cottage often, she was obliged
to work early and late, bending over the dress by the
dim candle light, until her head seemed bursting with
pain, and rings of fire danced before her eyes. She never
would have succeeded but for Uncle Sam, who proved a
most efficient member of the household, fitting in every
niche and corner, until Aunt Eunice wondered how she
had ever lived without him. Particularly did he attach
himself to Willie, relieving Adah from all care, and thus
enabling her to devote every spare moment to the party
dress.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’s workin’ yourself to death,” he said to her, as
late on Saturday night she sat bending to the tallow candle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>her hair brushed back from her forehead and a purplish
glow upon her cheek.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know I’m working too hard,” Adah replied, and leaning
back in her chair she closed her eyes wearily, while
Sam, gazing admiringly at her continued, “You ’minds
me some of de young lady in Virginny. Has I ever tole
you ’bout her?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, who was she?” Adah said, and Sam replied,</p>

<p class='c011'>“She’s what teached me the way to God. She took
my dried-up-hand in dem little soft ones of hern, white as
cotton bats, and lead me up to de narrow gap. She push
me in and say, ‘Go on now, Sam. You’ve got in de
right track, that leads to glory hallelujah.’ Didn’t word it
just dem words, be sure, but that’s the heft of the meaning.
I tell you Sam was mighty nigh as shipwrecked as
dat Pollo somebody what Miss <em>Ellis</em> read about in the
good book.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Miss who?</em>” Adah asked, and Sam replied,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Miss Ellis. I done forget de other name. <em>Ellis</em> they
call her way down thar whar Sam was sold, when dat
man with the big <em>splot</em> on his forerd steal me away and
sell me in Virginny. Miss ever hearn tell o’ dat?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Big <em>what</em>?” Adah asked, and Sam replied, “Big
<em>scar</em> or <em>mark</em> kinder purple, on his forrid, right clus to the
har.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Adah shuddered, for the one she knew as her guardian
was marked in that way, and she asked Sam to tell her
more of the man with the splot.</p>

<p class='c011'>Delighted to tell the story which he never tired of telling,
Sam, in his own peculiar dialect, related how four
years before, a man calling himself Sullivan had appeared
in the neighborhood of his former master’s plantation
ingratiating himself into the good graces of the negroes
and secretly offering to conduct any to the land of freedom
who would put themselves under his protection.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I had an idee,” Sam said, “that freedom was sweet as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>bumble bees’ honey and I hankered to get a taste, so me
and two more fools steal away from the old cabin one
rainy night, and go with Mas’r Sullivan, who strut round
mighty big, with his three niggers, tellin’ us not to say
one word ef we not want to be cotched. We thinks he’s
takin’ a bee line for Canada, when fust we knows we’s in
ole Virginny, and de villain not freein’ us at all. He sells
us. <em>Me</em> he most give away, ’case I was old, and the
mas’r who buy some like Mas’r Hugh, he sorry for ole
shaky nigger. Sam tell him on his knees how he comed
from Kaintuck, but Mas’r Sullivan say he bought ’em <em>far</em>,
and that the right mas’r sell ’em sneakin like to save raisin
a furse, and he show a bill of sale. They believe him
spite of dis chile, and so Sam ’long to anodder mas’r.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mas’r Fitzhugh live on big plantation—and one day she
comed, with great trunk, a visitin’. She’d been to school
with Miss Mabel, Mas’r Fitzhugh’s daughter.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They all think heap of Miss Ellis, and I hear de blacks
tellin’ how she berry rich, and comed from way off thar
whar white niggers live—Masser-something.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Massachusetts,” suggested Adah.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; that’s the very mas’r. I’se got mizzable memory,
and I disremembers her last name. The folks call her
<em>Ellis</em>, and the blacks Miss Ellis.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A queer name for a first one,” Adah thought, while
Sam continued,</p>

<p class='c011'>“She jest like a bright angel, in her white gownds and
dem long curls, and Sam like her so much. She talk to
Sam, too, and her voice so sweet, just like falling water
when the moon is shining on it. Sam very sick, want to
go home so much, and lie all day in his little cabin, when
she come in, holdin’ up her skirts so dainty like, and set
right down with me. Ki, wasn’t her little hand soft
though when she put it on my head and said, ‘Poor Sam,
Ellis is sorry.’ Sam cry berry much then; cry so loud
Miss Mabel hear, and come in, tellin’ Miss Ellis, ‘Pooh
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>he’s only homesick; says he was stole from Kentucky
but papa don’t believe him. Do come out of this hole,’
but Miss Ellis not go. She say, ‘Then he needs comforting,’
and she do that very thing. She talk so good, she
ax Sam all ’bout it, and Sam feel she b’lieve him. She
promise to write to Mas’r Brown and tell him whar I is.
I didn’t cry loud then—heart too full. I cry whimperin’
like, and she cry too. Then she tell me about <em>God</em>, and
Sam listen, oh, listen so much, for that’s what he want to
hear so long. Miss Nancy, in Kentuck, be one of them
that reads her pra’rs o’ Sundays, and ole mas’r one that
hollers ’em. Sam liked that way best, seemed like gettin’
along and make de Lord hear, but it don’t show Sam the
way, and when the ministers come in, he listen, but them that
reads and them that hollers only talk about <em>High and
Low—Jack and the Game</em>, or something, Sam misremembers
so bad; got mizzable memory. He only knows he
not find the way, till Miss Ellis tell him of <em>Jesus</em>, once a
man and always God. It’s very queer, but Sam believe
it and then she sing, ‘Come unto me.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, so fine, the very rafters hold their breff, and Sam
find the way. Sam feel the hand she say was stretched
out for him. He grasp it tight. He never let it go,
never cease thankin’ God that ‘Come unto me’ mean just
such an ole nigger as Sam, or that Miss Ellis was sent to
him. She teach me ‘Our Father,’ and I say it every day,
and I ’members her, too, and now I puts her and Mas’r
Hugh in de same words. Seems ef they make good span,
only Mas’r Hugh not so fixed up as she, but he’s good.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where is Miss Ellis now?” Adah asked, and Sam
replied,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gone home. Gone to Masser—what you say once—but
not till letter come to her from Mas’r Brown,
sayin’ Sam was stealed, and ’fore long Mas’r Brown come
on hisself after me and the others. Miss Ellis so glad,
and Mas’r Fitzhugh, too. Sam not much ’count, he say,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>and let me go easy, that’s the way I come home. Miss
Ellis gived me five dollars and then ask what else. I
look at her and say, ‘Sam wants a spear or two of yer
shinin’ har’, and Miss Mabel takes shears and cut a little
curl. I’se got ’em now. I never spend the money,” and
from an old leathern wallet Sam drew a bill and a soft
silken curl which he laid across Adah’s hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And where is Sullivan?” asked Adah, a chill creeping
over her as she remembered how about four years ago
the man she called her guardian was absent for some
time, and came back to her with colored hair and whiskers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, he gone long before, nobody know whar. Sam
b’lieves, though, he hear they cotch him, but misremembers,
got such mizzable memory.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You said he had a mark?” Adah continued. And
Sam replied, “Yes, queer mark,—must of been thar
when he was borned, showd better when he’s cussin mad.
You ever seen him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not know,” and Adah half groaned aloud at the sad
memories which Sam’s story had awakened within her.</p>

<p class='c011'>She could scarcely doubt that <em>Sullivan</em> the negro-stealer,
and Redfield, her guardian, were the same, but where
was he now, and why had he treated her so treacherously,
when he had always seemed so kind? Why did
everybody desert her? What had she done to deserve
so sad a fate? All the old bitter anguish was welling up
again, and desirous of being alone, she bade Sam leave
her as it was growing late.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Miss Adah prays,” the old man answered, “Won’t
she say Our Father with Sam?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Adah could not refuse, and falling on her knees she
joined her voice with that of Sam’s in that most beautiful
of all prayers—the one our Saviour taught. Sam
did not know it correctly, but God heard him all the
same; heard too, the strangely-worded petition that “He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>would bless Mas’r Hugh, Miss Ellis, and Miss Adah, and
fotch ’em all right some time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Surely Hugh’s sleep was sweeter that night for the
prayer breathed by the lowly negro, and even the wild
tumult in Adah’s heart was hushed by Sam’s simple
childlike faith that God would bring all right at last.</p>

<p class='c011'>Early on Monday afternoon ’Lina, taking advantage
of Hugh’s absence, came over for her dress, finding much
fault, and requiring some of the work to be done
twice ere it suited her. Without a murmur Adah obeyed,
but when the last stitch was taken and the party dress
was gone, her overtaxed frame gave way, and Sam himself
helped her to her bed, where she lay moaning, with
the blinding pain in her head, which increased so fast
that she scarcely saw the tempting little supper which
Aunt Eunice brought, asking her to eat. Of one thing,
however, she was conscious, and that of the dark form
bending over her pillow and whispering soothingly the
passage which had once brought Heaven to him, “Come
unto me, and I will give you rest.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Dear old Sam! there was a world of kindness in his
breast, and if he could he would gladly have taken
Adah’s suffering upon himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>The night had closed in dark and stormy, and the wintry
rain beat against the windows; but for this he did
not hesitate a moment when at midnight Aunt Eunice,
alarmed at Adah’s rapidly increasing fever, asked if he
could find his way to Spring Bank, and in a few moments
the old, shriveled form was out in the darkness, groping
its way over the fences, and through the pitfalls, stumbling
often, and losing his hat past recovery, so that the snowy
hair was dripping wet when Spring Bank was reached and
he stood upon the porch.</p>

<p class='c011'>In much alarm Hugh dressed himself and hastened to
the cottage. But Adah did not know him and only talked
of dresses and parties, and <em>George</em>, whom she begged to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>come back and restore her good name. The dresses and
the party were enigmas to Hugh, and as Aunt Eunice kept
silent for fear of his wrath, he gathered nothing from Sam’s
muttered jumble about, “working herself blind for Miss
’Lina over dar.” He knew she must have medical advice,
and giving a few directions to Aunt Eunice he went himself
for the family physician and then returned to Spring
Bank in quest of his mother, who, he was sure, would not
hesitate to brave the storm for Adah’s sake.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XII.<br> <span class='large'>WHAT FOLLOWED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>There was a bright light in the sitting-room, and through
the half-closed shutters Hugh caught glimpses of a blazing
fire. ’Lina had come home, and half wishing she had
staid a little longer, Hugh entered the room, starting with
an exclamation of surprise at the sight which met his view.
Divested of her gorgeous apparel, her ample dimensions
considerably reduced, and her face indicative of her feelings,
’Lina stood upon the hearth, wringing her long black
hair, which hung loosely about her shoulders, while her
mother bent with deep concern over the mud-bespattered,
ruined dress, which had cost so much.</p>

<p class='c011'>Poor ’Lina! The party had proved a most unsatisfactory
affair. She had not made the sensation she expected
to make. Harney had scarcely noticed her at all,
having neither eyes nor ears for any one save Ellen Tiffton,
who surely must have told that Hugh was not invited, for,
in no other way could ’Lina account for the remark she
heard touching her want of heart in failing to resent a
brother’s insult. Added to this, it was very annoying to be
quizzed, as she was, concerning <em>Adah</em>, of whom everybody
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>seemed resolved to talk. In the most unenviable of
moods, ’Lina left at an early hour, and though Harney did
accompany her to the carriage, saying something about being
sorry that she should go so soon when he meant to see
more of her, it did not atone for his past neglect or for his
holding the umbrella so that the little greenish streams of
water dripped directly down her back, making her fidget
with terror lest her rose-colored dress should be soiled.
Coolly bidding him good night, she bade Cæsar drive carefully,
as it was very dark, and the rain was almost blinding,
so rapidly it fell.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ye-es, Mis-s, Cæs—he—he done been to party ’fore
now. Git ’long dar, Sorrel,” hiccoughed the negro, who,
in Colonel Tiffton’s kitchen had indulged rather too freely
to insure the safety of his mistress.</p>

<p class='c011'>Still the horses knew the road, and kept it until they
left the main highway and turned into the fields. Even
then they would probably have made their way in safety,
had not their drunken driver persisted in turning them into
a road which led directly through the deepest part of the
creek, swollen now by the melted snow and the vast
amount of rain which had fallen since the sun-setting.
Not knowing they were wrong, ’Lina did not dream of
danger until she heard Cæsar’s cry of “Who’a dar, Sorrel.
Git up, Henry. Dat’s nothin’ but de creek,” while
a violent lurch of the carriage sent her to the opposite side
from where she had been sitting.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is the matter, Cæsar? Where are we?” she
screamed, as she heard the waters splashing almost against
the windows.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lor’, Miss, I do’ know whar we is, ’cept we’re in
the river. I never seen no creek so high as this,” was the
frightened negro’s answer as he tried to extricate the noble
brutes floundering in the stream and struggling to reach
the opposite bank.</p>

<p class='c011'>A few mad plunges, another wrench, which pitched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>’Lina headlong against the window, and the steep, shelving
bank was reached, but in endeavoring to climb it the
carriage was upset, and ’Lina found herself in pitchy
darkness, her mouth and nostrils filled with the soft mud,
which, at first, prevented her screaming, and herself wet
to her neck with the rushing water. Perfectly sobered
now, Cæsar extricated her as soon as possible, and carrying
her up the bank placed her upon her feet beneath a
tree, whose leafless branches but poorly shielded her from
the rain. The carriage was broken—one wheel was off
entirely, he said, and thus there was no alternative save
for ’Lina to walk the remaining distance home. It was
not far, for the scene of the disaster was within sight of
Spring Bank, but to ’Lina, bedraggled with mud and wet
to the skin, it seemed an interminable distance, and her
strength was giving out just as she reached the piazza, and
called on her mother for help, sobbing hysterically as she
repeated her story, but dwelling most upon her ruined
dress.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What will Hugh say? It was not paid for either.
Oh dear, I most wish I was dead!” she moaned, as her
mother removed one by one the saturated garments.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sight of Hugh called forth her grief afresh, and
forgetful of her dishabille, she staggered toward him, and
impulsively winding her arms around his neck sobbed
out,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Hugh, I’ve had such a doleful time. I’ve been
in the creek, the carriage is broken, the horses are lamed,
Cæsar is drunk, and—and—oh, Hugh, I’ve spoiled my
dress!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The last came gaspingly, as if this were the straw too
many, the crowning climax of the whole, the loss which
’Lina most deplored. Surely here was a list of disasters
for which Hugh, with his other trouble, was not prepared.
But amid it all there was a glimmer of light, and Hugh’s
great, warm heart seized it eagerly. ’Lina’s arms were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>round his neck, ’Lina’s tears were on his cheek, ’Lina herself
had turned to him for comfort, and he would not
withhold it. Laughing merrily he held her off at a little
distance, likening her to a mermaid fresh from the sea,
and succeeding at last in quieting her until she could give
a more concise account of the catastrophe.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never mind the dress,” he said, good humoredly, as
she kept recurring to that. “It isn’t as if it were new.
An old thing is never so valuable.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; but, Hugh—you don’t know—oh, dear, dear,”
and ’Lina, who had meant to tell the whole, broke down
again, while Hugh rejoined,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course I don’t know—just how a girl feels to
spoil a pretty dress, but I wouldn’t cry so hard. You
shall have another some time,” and in his generous heart
the thought arose, that the first money he got should be
appropriated to the purchase of a new dress in place of
the one whose loss ’Lina so loudly bewailed.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was impossible now for Mrs. Worthington to accompany
Hugh to the cottage, so he returned alone, while
’Lina, with aching head and shivering limbs, crept into
bed, crying herself to sleep, and waking in the morning
with a burning fever, scarcely less severe than that raging
in Adah Hastings’ veins.</p>

<p class='c011'>During the gloomy weeks which followed, Hugh’s heart
and hands were full, inclination tempting him to stay by
Adah, and stern duty, bidding him keep with ’Lina, who,
strange to say, was always more quiet when he was near
taking readily from him the medicine refused when offered
by her mother. Day after day, week after week, Hugh
watched alternately at their bedsides, and those who came
to offer help felt their hearts glow with admiration for the
worn, haggard man, whose character they had so mistaken,
never dreaming what depths of patient, all-enduring
tenderness were hidden beneath his rough exterior. Even
Ellen Tiffton was softened, and forgetting the Ladies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Fair, rode daily over to Spring Bank, ostensibly to inquire
after ’Lina, but really to speak a kindly word to Hugh, to
whom she felt she had done a wrong. How long these
fevers ran, and Hugh began to fear that ’Lina’s never
would abate, sorrowing much for the harsh words which
passed between them, wishing they had been unsaid, for
he would rather than none but pleasant memories should
be left to him of his only sister. But ’Lina did not die,
and as her disease had from the first assumed a far more
violent form than Adah’s, so it was the first to yield, and
February found her convalescent. With Adah it was
different, and the neighbors grew tired of asking how she
was and receiving always the same doubtful answer. But
there came a change, a morning when she awoke from the
deathlike stupor which had clouded her faculties so long,
and the attending physician said to Hugh that his services
would be needed but a little longer. There was joy at
the cottage then, old Uncle Sam stealing away to his
accustomed place of prayer down by the Willow Spring,
where he so oft had asked that Miss Adah might be
spared, and where now he knelt to thank the God who
had restored her. Joy at Spring Bank, too, when Mrs.
Worthington wept tears almost as joyful as any she had
shed when told that ’Lina would live. Joy, too, unobtrusive
joy in Hugh’s heart, a joy which would not be clouded by
thoughts of the heavy bills which he must meet ere long.
Physicians’ bills, together with that of Harney’s yet
unpaid, for Harney, villain though he was, would not
present it when Hugh was full of trouble; but the hour
was coming when it must be settled, and Hugh at last received
a note, couched in courteous terms, but urging
immediate payment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll see him to-day. I’ll know the worst at once,”
he said, and mounting Rocket, he dashed down the
Frankfort turnpike, and was soon closeted with Harney.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XIII.<br> <span class='large'>HOW HUGH PAID HIS DEBTS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The perspiration was standing in great drops about
Hugh’s quivering lips, and his face was white as ashes, as,
near the close of that interview, he hoarsely asked,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do I understand you, sir, that <em>Rocket</em> will cancel
this debt and leave you my debtor for one hundred
dollars?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, that was my offer, and a most generous one, too,
considering how little horses are bringing,” and Harney
smiled villainously as he thought within himself, “Easier
to manage than I supposed. I believe my soul I offered
too much. I should have made it an even thing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He did not know Hugh Worthington, or dream of the
volcano pent up beneath that calm exterior. Hugh had
demurred to the fifty-dollar silk as a mistake, and when
convinced that it was not, his wrath had known no bounds.
Forgetting Golden Hair he had sworn so roundly that
even Harney cowered before the storm; but that was over
now, and ashamed of his passion, Hugh was making a
strong effort to meet his fate like a man. Step by step
as he knew so well how to do, Harney had reached the
point of which for more than a year he had never lost
sight.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If Mr. Worthington had not the ready money, and,
in these hard times, it was natural to suppose he had not,
why then he would, as an accommodation, take Rocket,
paying one hundred dollars extra, and Hugh’s debt would
be cancelled.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hugh knew how long this plan had been premeditated,
and his blood boiled madly when he heard it suggested,
as if that moment had given it birth. Still he restrained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>himself, and asked the question we have recorded, adding
after Harney’s reply,</p>

<p class='c011'>“And suppose I do not care to part with Rocket?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Harney winced a little, but answered carelessly,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Money, of course, is just as good. You know how
long I’ve waited. Few would have done as well.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Yes, Hugh knew that, but Rocket was as dear to him
as his right eye, and he would almost as soon have plucked
out the one as sold the other.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have not the money,” he said frankly, “and I cannot
part with Rocket. Is there nothing else? I’ll give a
mortgage on Spring Bank.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Harney did not care for a mortgage, but there was
something else, and the rascally face brightened, as, stepping
back, while he made the proposition, he faintly suggested
“Lulu.” He would give a thousand dollars for
her, and Hugh could keep his horse. For a moment the
two young men regarded each other intently, Hugh’s eyes
flashing gleams of fire, and his whole face expressive of
the contempt he felt for the wretch who cowed at last beneath
the look, and turned away muttering that “he saw
nothing so very heinous in wishing to purchase a nigger
wench.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, changing his tone to one of defiance, he added,</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’ll be obliged to part with her yet, Hugh Worthington.
I know how you are straitened and how much
you think of her. You may not have another so good a
chance to provide her with a kind master. Surely, you
should be satisfied with that fair-haired New York damsel,
and let me have the nigger.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Harney tried to smile, but the laugh died on his lips, as,
springing to his feet, Hugh, with one blow, felled him to
the floor, exclaiming,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thus do I resent the insult offered to Adah Hastings,
as pure and true a woman as your own sister. Villain!”
and he shook fiercely his prostrate foe struggling to rise.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Some men are decidedly better for being knocked down,
and Harney was one of them. Feminine in figure and
cowardly in disposition, he knew he was no match for the
broad, athletic Hugh, and shaking down his pants when
permitted to stand upright, he muttered something about
“hearing from him again.” Then, as the sight of the unpaid
bill brought back to his mind the cause of his present
unpleasant predicament he returned to the attack, by
saying,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Since you are not inclined to part with either of your
pets, you’ll oblige me with the money, and before to-morrow
night. You understand me, I presume?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do,” and bowing haughtily, Hugh passed through
the open door.</p>

<p class='c011'>In a kind of desperation he mounted Rocket, and
dashed out of town at a speed which made more than
one look after him, wondering what cause there was for
his headlong haste. A few miles from the city he slacked
his speed, and dismounting by a running brook, sat down
to think. The price offered for Lulu would set him free
from every pressing debt, and leave a large surplus, but
not for a moment did he hesitate.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’d lead her out and shoot her through the heart, before
I’d do that,” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then turning to the noble animal cropping the grass
beside him, he wound his arms around his neck, and tried
to imagine how it would seem to know the stall at home
was empty, and Rocket gone. He could not sell him,
he said, as he looked into the creature’s eyes, meeting
there an expression almost human, as Rocket rubbed his
nose against his sleeve, and uttered a peculiar sound.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If I could pawn him,” he thought, just as the sound
of wheels was heard, and he saw old Colonel Tiffton driving
down the turnpike.</p>

<p class='c011'>Stopping suddenly as he caught sight of Hugh, the
colonel called out cheerily, “How d’ye, young man?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>What are you doing there by the brook? Huggin’ your
horse, as I live! Well, I don’t wonder. That’s a fine
nag of yours. My Nell is nigh about crazy for me to buy
him. What’ll you take?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hugh knew he could trust the colonel, and after a moment’s
hesitation told of his embarrassments, and asked
the loan of five hundred dollars, offering Rocket as security,
with the privilege of redeeming him in a year.
Hugh’s chin quivered, and the arm thrown across Rocket’s
neck pressed more tightly as he made this offer. Every
change in the expression of his face was noted by
the colonel, and interpreted with considerable accuracy.
He had always liked Hugh. There was something in his
straight-forward manner which pleased him, and when
he learned why he was not at his daughter’s birth-day
party, he had raised a most uncomfortable breeze about
the capricious Nellie’s ears, declaring she should apologize,
but forgetting to insist upon it as he at first meant
to do.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You ask a steep sum,” he said, crossing one fat limb
over the other and snapping his whip at Rocket, who
eyed him askance. “Pretty steep sum, but I take it, you
are in a tight spot and don’t know what else to do. Got
too many hangers on. There’s Aunt Eunice—you can’t
help her, to be sure, nor your mother, nor your sister,
though I’d break her neck before I’d let her run me into
debt. Your bill at Harney’s, I know, is most all of her
contracting, though you don’t tell me so, and I respect
you for it. She’s your sister—blood kin. But that girl
in the snow bank—I’ll be hanged if that was ever made
quite clear to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is to me, and that is sufficient,” Hugh answered
haughtily, while the old colonel laughingly replied,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good grit, Hugh. I like you for that. In short, I
like you for every thing, and that’s why I was sorry about
that New York lady. You see, it may stand in the way
of your getting a wife by and by, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>“I shall never marry,” Hugh answered, moodily, kicking
at a decaying stump, and involuntarily thinking of
the Golden Haired.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No?” the colonel replied, interrogatively. “Well
there ain’t many good enough for you, that’s a fact; there
ain’t many girls good for any body. I never saw but one
except my Nell, that was worth a picayune, and that was
<em>Alice Johnson</em>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Who? Who</em> did you say?” And Hugh grew white
as marble, while a strange light gleamed in the dark eyes
fastened so eagerly upon the colonel’s face.</p>

<p class='c011'>Fortunately for him the colonel was too much absorbed
in dislodging a <em>fly</em> from the back of his horse to notice his
agitation; but he heard the question and replied, “I said
Alice Johnson, twentieth cousin of mine—blast that fly!—lives
in Massachusetts; splendid girl—hang it all, can’t
I hit him?—I was there two years ago. Never saw a
girl that made my mouth water as she did. Most too pious,
though, to suit me. Wouldn’t read a newspaper
Sunday, when that’s the very day I take to read ’em—there,
I’ve killed him.” And well satisfied with the achievement,
the old colonel put up his whip, never dreaming of
the effect that name had produced on Hugh, whose heart
gave one great throb of hope, and then grew heavy and
sad as he thought how impossible it was that the Alice
Johnson the colonel knew, could be the Golden Haired.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There are fifty by that name, no doubt,” he said, “and
if there were not, she is dead. But oh, if it could be
that she were living, that somewhere I could find her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a mist before Hugh’s vision, and the arm encircling
Rocket’s neck clung there now for support, so
weak and faint he grew. He dared not question the colonel
farther, and was only too glad when the latter came
back to their starting point and said, “If I understand you,
I can have Rocket for five hundred dollars, provided I let
you redeem him within a year. Now that’s equivalent to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>my lending you five hundred dollars out and out. I see,
but seeing it’s you, I reckon I’ll have to do it. As luck
will have it, I was going down to Frankfort this very day
to put some money in the bank, and if you say so, we’ll
clinch the bargain at once;” and taking out his leathern
wallet, the colonel began to count the required amount.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice Johnson was forgotten in that moment of painful
indecision, when Hugh felt as if his very life was dying
out.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I can’t let Rocket go,” he thought, bowing his face
upon the animal’s graceful neck. Then chiding himself as
weak, he lifted up his head and said: “I’ll take the money.
Rocket is yours.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The last words were like a smothered sob; and the generous
old man hesitated a moment. But Hugh was in
earnest. His debts must be paid, and five hundred dollars
would do it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll bring him round to-morrow. Will that be time
enough?” he asked, as he rolled up the bills.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” the colonel replied, while Hugh continued entreatingly,
“and, colonel, you’ll be kind to Rocket. He’s
never been struck a blow since he was broken to the saddle.
He wouldn’t know what it meant.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, I see—Rarey’s method. Now I never could
make that work. Have to lick ’em sometimes, but I’ll remember
Rocket. Good day,” and gathering up his reins
Col. Tiffton rode slowly away, leaving Hugh in a maze of
bewilderment.</p>

<p class='c011'>That name still rang in his ears, and he repeated it
again and again, each time assuring himself how impossible
it was that it should be she—the only she to him in
all the world. And supposing it were, what did it
matter? What good could her existence do him? She
would despise him now—no position, no name, no money,
no Rocket, and here he paused, for above all thoughts
of the Golden Haired towered the terrible one that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Rocket was his no longer—that the evil he most
dreaded had come upon him. “But I’ll meet it like a
man,” he said, and springing into his saddle he rode back
to Frankfort and dismounted at Harney’s door.</p>

<p class='c011'>In dogged silence Harney received the money, gave his
receipt, and then, without a word, watched Hugh as he
rode again from town, muttering to himself, “I shall remember
that he knocked me down, and some time I’ll repay
it.”</p>

<hr class='c014'>

<p class='c011'>It was dark when Hugh reach home, his lowering
brow and flashing eyes indicating the fierce storm which
was gathering, and which burst the moment he entered the
room where ’Lina was sitting. In tones which made
even her tremble he accused her of her treachery, pouring
forth such a torrent of wrath that his mother urged him
to stop, for her sake if no other. She could always
quiet Hugh, and he calmed down at once, hurling but
one more missile at his sister, and that in the shape
of Rocket, who, he said, was sold for her extravagance.</p>

<p class='c011'>’Lina was proud of Rocket, and the knowledge that he
was sold touched her far more than all Hugh’s angry
words. But her tears were of no avail; the deed was
done, and on the morrow Hugh, with an unflinching hand,
led his idol from the stable and rode rapidly across the
fields, leading another horse which was to bring him
home.</p>

<p class='c011'>Gloomily the next morning broke, and at rather a late
hour for him, Hugh, with a heavy sigh, had raised himself
upon his elbow, wondering if it were a dream, or if during
the night he had really heard Rocket’s familiar tramp
upon the lawn, when Lulu came running up the stairs;
exclaiming, joyfully,</p>

<p class='c011'>“He’s done come home, Rocket has. He’s at the kitchen
door.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was as Lulu said, for the homesick brute, suspecting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>something wrong, had broken from his fastenings, and
bursting the stable door had come back to Spring Bank,
his halter dangling about his neck, and himself looking
very defiant, as if he were not again to be coaxed away.
At sight of Hugh he uttered a sound of joy, and bounding
forward planted both feet within the door ere Hugh had
time to reach it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thar’s the old colonel now,” whispered Claib, just as
the colonel appeared to claim his runaway.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Rocket kept them all at bay, snapping, striking,
and kicking at every one who ventured to approach him.
With compressed lip and moody face Hugh watched the
proceeding for a time, now laughing at the frightened
negroes hiding behind the lye leach to escape the range
of Rocket’s heels, and again groaning mentally as he met
the half human look of Rocket’s eyes turned to him as if
for aid. At last rising from the spot where he had been
sitting he gave the whistle which Rocket always obeyed,
and in an instant the sagacious animal was at his side,
trying to lick the hands which would not suffer the caress
lest his courage should give way.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll take him home myself,” he said to the old colonel,
emerging from his hiding place behind the leach, and
bidding Claib follow with another horse, Hugh went a
second time to Colonel Tiffton’s farm.</p>

<p class='c011'>Leading Rocket into the stable he fastened him to the
stall, and then with his arms around his neck talked to
him as if he had been a refractory, disobedient child. We
do not say he was understood, but after one long, despairing
cry, which rang in Hugh’s ears for many a day and
night, Rocket submitted to his fate, and staid quietly
with the colonel, who petted him if possible more than
Hugh had done, without, however, receiving from him
the slightest token of affection in return.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XIV.<br> <span class='large'>MRS. JOHNSON’S LETTER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The spring had passed away, and the warm June sun
was shining over Spring Bank, whose mistress and servants
were very lonely, for Hugh was absent, and with him
the light of the house had departed. Business of his late
uncle’s had taken him to New Orleans, where he might
possibly remain all summer. <em>’Lina</em> was glad, for since
the fatal dress affair there had been but little harmony
between herself and her brother. The tenderness awakened
by her long illness seemed to have been forgotten,
and Hugh’s manner toward her was cold and irritating to
the last degree, so that the young lady rejoiced to be
freed from his presence.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do hope he’ll stay,” she said one morning, when
speaking of him to her mother. “I think it’s a heap nicer
without him, though dull enough at the best. I wish
we could go to some watering place. There’s the Tifftons
just returned from New York, and I don’t much believe
they can afford it more than we, for I heard their
place was mortgaged to Harney. Oh, bother, to be so
poor,” and the young lady gave a little angry jerk at the
hair she was braiding.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Whar’s ole miss?” asked Claib, who had just returned
from Versailles. “Thar’s a letter for her,” and depositing
it upon the bureau, he left the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Whose writing is that?” ’Lina said, catching it up
and examining the postmark. “Ho, mother! here’s a letter
in a strange handwriting. Shall I open it?” she
called, and ere her mother could reply, she had broken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>the seal, and held in her hand the draft which made her
the heiress of one thousand dollars.</p>

<p class='c011'>Had the fabled godmother of Cinderilla appeared to
her suddenly, she would scarcely have been more bewildered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mother,” she screamed again, reading aloud the ‘Pay
to the order of Adaline Worthington,’ etc. “What does
it mean, and who could have sent it? Isn’t it splendid!
Who is Alice Johnson? Oh, I know, that old friend of
yours, who came to see you once when I was gone.
What does she say? ‘My dear Eliza, feeling that I have
not long to live—’ What—dead? Well, I’m sorry
for that, but, I must say, she did a very sensible thing
sending me a thousand dollars. We’ll go somewhere
now, won’t we?” and clutching fast the draft, the heartless
girl yielded the letter to her mother, who with
blanched cheek and quivering lip read the last message
of her friend; then burying her face in her hands she
sobbed as the past came back to her, when the Alice
now forever at rest and herself were girls together.</p>

<p class='c011'>’Lina stood a moment, wishing her mother had not
cried, as it made it very awkward—then, for want of
something better to do took up the letter her mother had
dropped and read it through, commenting as she read.
“Wants you to take her daughter Alice. Is the woman crazy?
And her nurse, Densie Densmore. Say, mother, you’ve
cried enough, let’s talk the matter over. Shall you let Alice
come? Ten dollars a week, they’ll pay. Five hundred
and twenty dollars a year. Whew! We are rich as
Jews. It won’t cost half that sum to keep them. Our
ship is really coming in.”</p>

<p class='c011'>By this time Mrs. Worthington was able to talk of a
matter which had apparently so delighted ’Lina. Her
first remark, however, was not very pleasing to the young
lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As far as I am concerned I would willingly give Alice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>a home, but it’s not for me to say. Hugh alone can decide
it. We must write to him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You know he’ll refuse,” was ’Lina’s angry reply.
“He hates young ladies. So if it hangs on his decision,
you may as well save your postage stamp to New Orleans,
and write at once to Miss Johnson that she cannot
come, on account of a boorish clown.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Lina,” feebly interposed Mrs. Worthington, feeling
how inefficient she was to cope with ’Lina’s stronger
will. “Lina, we must write to Hugh.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mother, you shall not,” and ’Lina spoke determinedly.
“I’ll send an answer to this letter myself, this very day.
I will not suffer the chance to be thrown away. Hugh
may swear a little at first, but he’ll get over it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hugh never swears,” and Mrs. Worthington spoke up
at once.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He don’t, hey? Maybe you’ve forgotten when he
came home from Frankfort, that time he heard about my
dress. As old Sam says, ‘I’ve got a mizzable memory,
but I have a very distinct recollection that oaths were
thick as hail stones. Didn’t his eyes blaze though!’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know he swore then; but he never has since, I’m
sure, and I think he is better, gentler, more refined than he
used to be, since—since—<em>Adah</em> came.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A contemptuous “pshaw!” came from ’Lina’s lips, and
then she proceeded to speak of Alice Johnson, asking for
her family. Were they the F. F. V.’s of Boston? and so
forth.</p>

<p class='c011'>To this Mrs. Worthington gave a decided affirmative;
repeating to her daughter many things which Mrs. Johnson
had herself told Alice in that sad interview when she
lay on her sick bed with Alice sobbing near.</p>

<p class='c011'>So far as she was concerned, Alice Johnson was welcome
to Spring Bank; but justice demanded that Hugh should
be consulted ere an answer were returned. ’Lina, however,
overruled her arguments as she always did, and with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>a sigh she yielded the point, hoping there would be some
way by which Hugh might be appeased.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now let us talk a little about the thousand dollars,” ’Lina said, for already the money was beginning to burn
in her hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m going to Saratoga, and you are going, too. We’ll
have heaps of dresses. We’ll take <em>Lu</em>, for a waiting-maid. That will be sure to make a sensation at the
North. ‘Mrs. Worthington, daughter, and colored servant,
Spring Bank, Kentucky.’ I can almost see that on the
clerk’s books. Then I can manage to let it be known that
I’m an heiress, as I am. We needn’t tell that it’s only a
thousand dollars, most of which I have on my back, and
maybe I’ll come home <em>Adaline</em> somebody else. There are
always splendid matches at Saratoga. We’ll go north the
middle of July, just three weeks from now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>’Lina had talked so fist that Mrs. Worthington had
been unable to put in a word; but it did not matter.
’Lina was invulnerable to all she could say. She’d go to
town that very day and make her purchases. Miss Allis,
of course, must be consulted for some of her dresses, while
<em>Adah</em> could make the rest. With regard to Miss Alice,
they would write to her at once, telling her she was welcome
to Spring Bank, and also informing her of their intentions
to come north immediately. She could join
them at Saratoga, or, if she preferred, could remain at
Snowdon until they returned home in the autumn.</p>

<p class='c011'>’Lina’s decision with regard to their future movements
had been made so rapidly and so determinedly, that Mrs.
Worthington had scarcely ventured to expostulate, and
the few remonstrances she did advance produced no impression.
’Lina wrote to Alice Johnson that morning,
went to Frankfort that afternoon, to Versailles and Lexington
the next day, and on the morning of the third, after
the receipt of Mrs. Johnson’s letter, Spring Bank presented
the appearance of one vast show-room, so full of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>silks, and muslins, and tissues, and flowers, and ribbons,
and laces, while amidst it all, in a maze of perplexity as
to what was required of her, or where first to commence,
sat Adah, who had come at ’Lina’s bidding.</p>

<p class='c011'>Womanlike, the sight of ’Lina’s dresses awoke in
Adah a thrill of delight, and she entered heartily into the
matter without a single feeling of envy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’s goin’, too. Did you know that?” Lulu said to
her, as she sat bending over a cloud of lace and soft blue
silk.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You? For what?” and Adah lifted her brown eyes
inquiringly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, goin’ to wait on ’em. It’s grand to have a nigger
and Miss ’Lina keeps trainin’ me how to act and
what to say. I ain’t to tell how mean Spring Bank is
furnished, nor how poor master Hugh is. Nothin’ of
the kind. We’re to be fust cut. Oh, so nice, Miss ’Lina
an, <em>Airey</em>, and when we get home, if I does well, I’m to
hev that gownd, all mud, what Miss ’Lina wared to the
Tiffton party, whew!” and in the mischievous glance of
Lulu’s saucy eyes, Adah read that the quick-witted negro
was not in the least deceived with regard to the “Airey,”
as she called Miss ’Lina.</p>

<p class='c011'>Half amused at Lulu’s remarks and half sorry that she
had listened to them, Adah resumed her work, just as
’Lina appeared, saying to her, “Here is Miss Tiffton’s
square-necked bertha. She’s just got home from New
York, and says they are all the fashion. You are to cut
me a pattern. There’s a paper, the Louisville Journal, I
guess, but nobody reads it, now Hugh is gone,” and with
a few more general directions, ’Lina hurried away, having
first tossed into Adah’s lap the paper containing Anna
Richards’ advertisement.</p>

<p class='c011'>In spite of the doctor’s predictions and consignment of
that girl to Georgia, or some warmer place, it had reached
her at last. The compositor had wondered at its wording,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>a few casual readers had wondered at it, too—a western
editor, laughing jocosely at its “married or unfortunate
woman with a child a few months old,” had copied it into
his columns, thus attracting the attention of his more
south-western neighbor, who had thought it too good to
lose and so given it to his readers with sundry remarks
of his own. But through all its many changes, Adah’s
God had watched it, and brought it around to her. She
did not see it at first, but just as her scissors were raised
to cut the pattern, her eyes fell on the spot headed, “A
curious advertisement,” and suspending her operations
for a moment, she read it through, a feeling rising in her
heart that it was surely an answer to her own advertisement
sent forth months ago, with tearful prayers that it might
be successful. She did not know that “A. E. R.” meant it
for her, and no one else. She only felt that at Terrace
Hall there was a place for her, a home where she would
no longer be dependent on Hugh, whose straits she understood
perfectly well, knowing why Rocket was sold, and
how it hurt his master to sell him. Oh, if she only could
redeem him, no toil, no weariness would be too great; but
she never could, even if “A. E. R.” should take her—the
pay would be so small that Rocket would be old and
worthless ere she could earn five hundred dollars; but she
could do something toward it, and her heart grew light and
happy as she thought how surprised Hugh would be to
receive a letter containing money earned by the feeble
Adah, to whom he had been so kind.</p>

<p class='c011'>Adah was a famous castle-builder, and she went on
rearing castle after castle, until ’Lina came back again and
taking a seat beside her, began to talk so familiarly and
pleasantly that Adah felt emboldened to tell her of the
advertisement and her intention to answer it. Averse
as ’Lina had at first been to Adah’s remaining at
Spring Bank, she now saw a channel through which she
could be made very useful, and would far rather that she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>should remain. So she opposed the plan, urging so many
arguments against it that Adah began to think the idea a
foolish one, and with a sigh dismissed it from her mind
until another time, when she might give it more consideration.</p>

<p class='c011'>That afternoon Ellen Tiffton rode over to see ’Lina,
who told her of Alice Johnson, whom they were expecting.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alice Johnson,” Ellen repeated; “why, that’s the
girl father says so much about. Fortieth or fiftieth cousin.
He was at their house in Boston a few years ago, and
when he came home he annoyed me terribly by quoting
Alice continually, and comparing me with her. Of course
I fell in the scale, for there was nothing like Alice, Alice—so
beautiful, so refined, so sweet, so amiable, so <em>religious</em>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Religious!” and ’Lina laughed scornfully. “Adah pretends
to be religious, too, and so does Sam, while Alice
will make three. Pleasant prospects ahead. I wonder
if she’s the blue kind—thinks dancing wicked, and all
that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ellen could not tell. She only knew what her father
said; but she did not fancy Miss Alice to be more morose
or gloomy—at all events she would gladly have her for
a companion, and she thought it queer that Mrs. Johnson
should send her to a stranger, as it were, when they
would have been so glad to receive her. “Pa won’t like it
a bit, I know, and I quite envy you,” she said, as she took
her leave, her remarks raising Alice largely in ’Lina’s
estimation, and making her not a little proud that Spring
Bank had been selected as Miss Johnson’s home.</p>

<p class='c011'>One week later, and there came a letter from Alice herself
saying that at present she was stopping in Boston
with her guardian, Mr. Liston, who had rented the cottage
in Snowdon, but that she would meet Mrs. Worthington
and daughter at Saratoga. Of course she did not now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>feel like mingling in gay society, and should consequently
go to the Columbian, where she could be comparatively
quiet but this need not interfere with their arrangements,
as they could see each other often.</p>

<p class='c011'>The same day also brought a letter from Hugh, making
many kind inquiries after them all, saying his business was
turning out better than he expected, and enclosing forty
dollars, fifteen of which, he said, was for Adah, and the
rest for Ad, as a peace offering for the harsh things he had
said to her. Hugh’s conscience when away was always
troubling him with regard to ’Lina, and knowing that
money with her would atone for a score of sins, he had
felt so happy in sending it, giving her the most because he
had sinned against her the most. Once the thought suggested
itself that possibly she might keep the whole, but
he repudiated it at once as a base slander upon ’Lina.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alas, he little suspected the treachery of which she was
capable. As a taste of blood makes wild beasts thirst for
more, so Mrs. Johnson’s legacy had made ’Lina greedy for
gold, and the sight of the smooth paper bills sent to her
by Hugh, awoke her avaricious passions. Forty dollars
was just the price of a superb pearl bracelet in Lexington,
and if Hugh had only sent it all to her instead of a
part to Adah! What did Adah want of money, any way,
living there in the cornfield, and seeing nobody? Besides
that, hadn’t she just paid her three dollars, and a muslin
dress, and was that not enough for a girl in her circumstances?
Nobody would be the wiser if she kept the whole,
for her mother was not present when Claib brought the
letter. She’d never know they’d heard from Hugh; and
on the whole she believed she’d keep it, and so she went
to Lexington next day in quest of the bracelet, which
was pronounced beautiful by the unsuspecting Adah, who
never dreamed that her money had helped to pay for it.
Truly ’Lina was heaping up against herself a dark catalogue
of sin to be avenged some day, but the time was
not yet.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Thus far every thing went swimmingly. The dresses fitted
admirably, and nothing could exceed the care with which
they had been packed. Her mother no longer annoyed her
about Hugh. Lulu was quite well posted with regard to
her duty. Ellen Tiffton had lent her quizzing-glass and
several ornaments, while Irving Stanley, grand-nephew
like Hugh, to Uncle John, was to be at Saratoga, so ’Lina
incidentally heard, and as there was a kind of relationship
between them, he would of course notice her more or
less, and from all accounts, to be noticed by him was a
thing to be desired.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus it was in the best of humors that ’Lina tripped
from Spring Bank door one pleasant July morning, and
was driven with her mother and Lulu to Lexington,
where they intended taking the evening train for Cincinnati.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XV.<br> <span class='large'>SARATOGA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Mrs. Worthington</span>, daughter, and, colored servant.
Spring Bank, Ky.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Dr. John Richards</span> and mother, New York City.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Irving Stanley</span>, Esq., Baltimore.”</p>

<p class='c011'>These were the last entries made by the clerk at Union
Hall, which was so crowded, that for the new comers no
rooms were found except the small, uncomfortable ones
far up in the fourth story of the Ainsworth block, and
thither, in not the most amiable mood, ’Lina followed her
trunks, and was followed in turn by her mother and Lulu,
the crowd whom they passed deciphering the name upon
the trunks and whispering to each other, “From Spring
Bank, Kentucky. Haughty looking girl, wasn’t she?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>From his little twelve by ten apartment, where the
summer sun was pouring in a perfect blaze of heat, Dr.
Richards saw them pass, and after wondering who they
were, gave them no farther thought, but sat jamming his
pen-knife into the old worm-eaten table, and thinking
savage thoughts against that capricious lady, Fortune,
who had compelled him to come to Saratoga, where rich
wives were supposed to be had for the asking. Too late
he had discovered the ruse imposed on him by Mr. Liston—had
discovered that Alice was the heiress of more than
$50,000, and following the discovery came the mortifying
knowledge that not one dime of it would probably ever
be used for defraying his personal expenses. Alice had
learned how purely sordid and selfish was the man whom
she had thought so misunderstood by the Snowdonites,
and in Dr. Richard’s vest pocket there lay at this very moment
a note, the meaning of which was that Alice Johnson
declined the honor of becoming his wife. They would still
be friends, she said; would meet as if nothing had occurred,
but she could not be his wife. This it was which
had brought him to Saratoga, indignant, mortified and
desperate. There were other heiresses beside Alice Johnson—others
less fastidious; and he could find them, too.
Love was out of the question, as that had died with poor
Lily, so that now he was ready for the first chance that
offered, provided that chance possessed a certain style, and
was tolerably good-looking. He did not see ’Lina at all,
for she had passed the door before he looked up, so he
only saw the mother, with Lulu trudging obediently behind,
and hearing them enter the room, returned to his
cogitations.</p>

<p class='c011'>From his pleasanter, airier apartment, on the other side
of the narrow hall, Irving Stanley looked through his
golden glasses, pitying the poor ladies condemned to that
slow roast, thinking how, if he knew them, he would surely
offer to exchange, as it did not matter so much where a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>man was stowed away, he was so seldom in his room, while
ladies must necessarily spend half their time there at
least in dressing; and with a sigh for unfortunate ladies
in general, the kind-hearted Irving Stanley closed his door
and proceeded to make his own toilet for dinner, then only
an hour in the future.</p>

<p class='c011'>How hot, and dusty, and cross ’Lina was, and what a
look of dismay she cast around the room, with its two
bedsteads, its bureaus, its table, its washstand, and its dozen
pegs for her two dozen dresses, to say nothing of her
mother’s. She’d like to know if this was Saratoga, and
these its accommodations. It was not fit to put the pigs in,
and she wondered what the proprietor was thinking of
when he sent her up there.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I s’pects he didn’t know how you was an <em>Airey</em>,” Lulu
said, demurely, her eyes brimming with mischief.</p>

<p class='c011'>’Lina turned to box her ears, but the black face was so
grave and solemn in its expression that she changed her
mind, thinking she had been mistaken in Lulu’s ironical
tone.</p>

<p class='c011'>How tired and faint poor Mrs. Worthington was, and
how she wished she had staid at home, like a sensible woman,
instead of coming here to be made so uncomfortable
in this hot room. But it could not now be helped, ’Lina
said; they must do the best they could; and with a forlorn
glance at the luxuriant patch of weeds, the most prominent
view from the window, ’Lina opened one of her
trunks, and spreading a part of the contents upon the bed,
began to dress for dinner, changing her mind three times,
driving her mother and Lulu nearly distracted, and finally
deciding upon a rich green silk, which, with its crimson
trimmings, was very becoming to her dark style, but excessively
hot-looking on that sultry day. But ’Lina meant
to make a good first impression. Everything depended
upon that, and as the green was the heaviest, richest thing
she had, so she would first appear in it. Besides that, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>two young men who had looked at her from the door had
not escaped her observation. She had seen them both, deciding
that Dr. Richards was the most distingue of the
two, though Irving Stanley was very elegant, very refined,
and very intellectual looking in those glasses, which gave
him so scholarly an appearance. ’Lina never dreamed
that this was Irving Stanley, or she would have occupied
far more time in brushing her hair and coiling among its
braids the bandeau of pearls borrowed of Ellen Tiffton.
As it was, the dinner bell had long since ceased ringing,
and the tread of feet ceased in the halls below ere she descended
to the deserted parlor, followed by her mother,
nervous and frightened at the prospect of this, her first
appearance at Saratoga.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pray, rouse yourself,” ’Lina whispered, as she saw
how white she was, when she learned that their seats
were at the extreme end of the dining room—that in
order to reach it, nearly one thousand pair of eyes must
be encountered, and one thousand glances braved.
“Rouse yourself, do; and not let them guess you were
never at a watering place before,” and ’Lina thoughtfully
smoothed her mother’s cap by way of reassuring her.</p>

<p class='c011'>But even ’Lina herself quailed when she reached the
door and caught a glimpse of the busy life within, the terrible
ordeal she must pass.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, for a pair of pantaloons to walk beside one, even
if Hugh were in them,” she thought, as her own and her
mother’s lonely condition rose before her.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Hugh was watching a flat boat on the Mississippi
that summer afternoon, and as there was no other person
on whom she had a claim, she must meet her fate alone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Courage, mother,” she whispered again, and then advanced
into the room, growing bolder at every step, for
with one rapid glance she had swept the hall, and felt
that amid that bevy of beauty and fashion there were
few more showy than ’Lina Worthington in her rustling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>dress of green, with Ellen Tiffton’s bracelet on one arm
and the one bought with Adah’s money on the other.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here, madam,” and their conductor pointed to chairs
directly opposite Dr. Richards, watching them as they
came up to the hall, and deciding that the young lady’s
arms were most too white for her dark skin, and her
cheeks a trifle too red.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s put on skillfully, though,” he thought, while the
showily dressed old lady beside him whispered,</p>

<p class='c011'>“What elegant bracelets, and handsome point lace collar!”
just as ’Lina haughtily ordered the servant to move
her chair a little farther from the table.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bowing deferentially, the polite attendant quickly drew
back her chair, while she spread out her flowing skirts to
an extent which threatened to envelop her mother, sinking
meekly into her seat, confused and flurried. But alas
for ’Lina. The servant did not calculate the distance
aright, and the lady, who had meant to do the thing so
gracefully, who had intended showing the people that she
had been to Saratoga before, suddenly found herself,
prostrate upon the floor, her chair some way behind her,
and the plate, which, in her descent, she had grasped unconsciously,
flying off diagonally past her mother’s head,
and fortunately past the head of her mother’s left-hand
neighbor.</p>

<p class='c011'>Poor ’Lina! How she wished she might never get up
again. How she hoped the floor beneath would open and
swallow her up, and how she mentally anathematized the
careless negro, choking with suppressed laughter behind
her. As she struggled to arise she was vaguely conscious
that a white hand was stretched out to help her, that the
same hand smoothed her dress and held her chair
safely. Too much chagrined to think who it was rendering
her these little attentions, she took her seat, glancing
up and down the table to witness the effect of her
mishap.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>There was a look of consternation on Dr. Richards
face, but he was too well bred to laugh, or even to smile,
though there was a visible desire to do so, an expression,
which ’Lina construed into contempt for her awkwardness,
and then he went on with his previous occupation, that
of crumbling his bread and scanning the ladies near, while
waiting for the next course. There was also a look of
surprise in the face of the lady next to him, and then she
too occupied herself with something else.</p>

<p class='c011'>At first, ’Lina thought nothing could keep her tears
back, they gathered so fast in her eyes, and her voice
trembled so that she could not answer the servant’s question,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Soup, madam, soup?”</p>

<p class='c011'>But he of the white hand did it for her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course she’ll take soup,” then in an aside, he said
to her gently, “Never mind, you are not the first lady
who has been served in that way. It’s quite a common
occurrence.” There was something reassuring in his voice,
and turning toward him ’Lina caught the gleam of the
golden glasses, and knew that her <i><span lang="fr">vis-à-vis</span></i> up stairs was
also her right-hand neighbor. How grateful she felt for
his kind attentions, paid so delicately, and with an evident
desire to shield her from remark, and how she wondered
who he was, as he tried, by numberless unobtrusive
acts, to quiet her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kind and gentle as a woman, Irving Stanley was sometimes
laughed at by his own sex, as too gentle, too
feminine in disposition; but those who knew him best
loved him most, and loved him, too, just because he was
not so stern, so harsh, so overbearing as men are wont to be.
A woman was a sacred piece of mechanism to him—a
something to be petted, humored and caressed, and still
treated as an equal. The most considerate of sons, the
most affectionate of brothers, he was idolized at home,
while the society in which he mingled, knew no greater
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>favorite, and ’Lina might well be thankful that her lot was
cast so near him. He did not talk to her at the table further
than a few commonplace remarks, but when after
dinner was over, and his Havana smoked, he found her
sitting with her mother out in the grove, apart from
everybody, and knew that they were there alone, he
went to them, and ere many minutes had elapsed discovered
to his surprise that they were his so called cousins from
Kentucky. Nothing could exceed ’Lina’s delight. He
was there unfettered by mother or sister or sweetheart,
and of course would attach himself exclusively to her.
’Lina was very happy, and more than once her loud laugh
rang out so loud that Irving, with all his charity, had a
faint suspicion that round his Kentucky cousin, there
might linger a species of coarseness, not altogether
agreeable to one of his refinement. Still he sat chatting
with her until the knowing dowagers, who year after year
watch such things at Saratoga, whispered behind their
fans of a flirtation between the elegant Mr. Stanley and
that haughty looking girl from Kentucky.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I never saw him so familiar with a stranger upon so
short an acquaintance,” said Mrs. Buford, whose three
daughters would any one of them have exchanged their
name for Stanley. “I wonder if he knew her before. Upon
my word, that laugh of hers is rather coarse, let her
be who she will.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, but that silk never cost less than three dollars a
yard at Stewart’s. See the lustre there is on it,” and old
Mrs. Richards, who had brought herself into the field by
way of assisting her son in his campaign, levelled her glass
at ’Lina’s green silk, showing well in the bright sunlight
“Here, John,” she called to her son, who was passing
“can you tell me who that young lady is—the one who
so very awkwardly sat down upon the floor at dinner?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not know, and I cannot say that I wish to,” was
the <em>nonchalant</em> reply, as the doctor took the vacant chair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>his mother had so long been keeping for him. “I hardly
fancy her style. She’s too <i><span lang="fr">brusque</span></i> to suit me, though
Irving Stanley seems to find her agreeable.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is that Irving Stanley?” and Mrs. Richards levelled
her glass again, for Irving Stanley was not unknown to
her by reputation. “She must be somebody, John, or he
would not notice her,” and she spoke in an aside, adding
in a louder tone, “I wonder who she is. There’s their servant.
I mean to question her,” and as Lulu came near,
she said, “Girl, who do you belong to?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Longs to them,” jerking her head toward ’Lina and
Mrs. Worthington.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where do you live?” was the next query, and Lulu
replied.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Spring Bank, Kentucky. Missus live in big house,
most as big as this.” Then anxious to have the ordeal
passed, and fearful that she might not acquit herself satisfactorily
to ’Lina, who, without seeming to notice her, had
drawn near enough to hear, she added, “Miss ’Lina is an
airey, a very large <em>airey</em>, and has a heap of—of——”
Lulu hardly knew what, but finally in desperation added,
“a heap of ars,” and then fled away ere another question
could be asked her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>What</em> did she say she was?” Mrs. Richards asked,
and the doctor replied,</p>

<p class='c011'>“She said an <em>airey</em>. She meant an heiress.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, an heiress. I don’t doubt it, from her appearance,
and Mr. Stanley’s attentions. <em>Stylish looking</em>
isn’t she?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rather, yes—magnificent eyes at all events,” and the
doctor stroked his mustache thoughtfully, while his mother,
turning to Mrs. Buford, began to compliment ’Lina’s
form, and the fit of her dress.</p>

<p class='c011'>Money, or the reputation of possessing money, is an all
powerful charm, and in a few places does it show its power
more plainly than at Saratoga, where it was soon known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>that the lady from Spring Bank was heiress to immense
wealth in Kentucky, how immense nobody knew, and various
were the estimates put upon it. Among Mrs. Buford’s
clique it was twenty thousand; farther away and
in another hall it was fifty, while Mrs. Richards, ere the
supper hour arrived, had heard that it was at least a hundred
thousand dollars. How or where she heard it she
hardly knew, but she endorsed the statement as correct,
and at the tea table that night was exceedingly gracious
to ’Lina and her mother, offering to divide a little private
dish which she had ordered for herself, and into which
poor Mrs. Worthington inadvertently dipped, never
dreaming that it was not common property.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was not of the slightest consequence, Mrs. Richards
was delighted to share it with her,” and that was the way
the conversation commenced.</p>

<p class='c011'>’Lina knew now that the proud man whose lip had
curled so scornfully at dinner, was Dr. Richards, and Dr.
Richards knew that the girl who sat on the floor was ’Lina
Worthington, from Spring Bank, where Alice Johnson
was going.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I did not gather from Mr. Liston that these Worthingtons
were wealthy,” he said to himself, “but if the old
codger would deceive me with regard to Miss Johnson, he
would with regard to them,” and mentally resolving to
make an impression before they could see and talk with
Alice, the doctor was so polite that ’Lina scarcely knew
whose attentions to prefer, his or Irving Stanley’s, who,
rather glad of a co-worker, yielded the field without a
struggle, and by the time tea was over the doctor’s star
was in the ascendant.</p>

<p class='c011'>How ’Lina wanted to stay in the crowded parlors, but
her mother had so set her heart upon seeing Alice Johnson,
that she was forced to humor her, and repaired to her
room to make a still more elaborate toilet, as she wished
to impress Miss Johnson with a sense of her importance.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>A pale blue silk, with white roses in her hair, was finally
decided upon, and when, just as the gas was lighted;
she descended with her mother to the parlor, her opera
cloak thrown gracefully around her uncovered shoulders,
and Ellen Tiffton’s glass in her hand, she had the satisfaction
of knowing that she created quite a sensation, and
that others than Dr. Richards looked after her admiringly
as she swept through the room, followed by her mother
and <em>Lulu</em>, the latter of whom was answering no earthly
purpose save to show that they had a servant.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XVI.<br> <span class='large'>THE COLUMBIAN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>It was very quiet at the Columbian, and the few gentlemen
seated upon the piazza seemed to be of a different
stamp from those at the more fashionable houses, as there
were none of them smoking, nor did they stare impertinently
at the gayly dressed lady coming up the steps,
and inquiring of the clerk if Miss Alice Johnson were
there.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, she was, and her room was No. ——. Should he
send up the lady’s card? Miss Johnson had mostly kept
to her room.”</p>

<p class='c011'>’Lina had brought no card, but she gave her name and
passed on into the parlor, which afforded a striking contrast
to the beehive down town. In a corner two or
three were sitting; another group occupied a window
while at the piano were two more, an old and a young
lady; the latter of whom was seated upon the stool, and
with her foot upon the soft pedal, was alternately striking
a few sweet musical chords, and talking to her companion,
who seemed to be a servant. Taking her seat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>near these last, ’Lina watched them curiously; a thought
once crossing her mind that this might be <em>Alice Johnson</em>.
But no; Alice, of course, would be habited in deepest
black, while the dress this lady wore was a simple, pure
white, unrelieved by any color save the jet bracelets upon
the snowy arms and the jet pin at the throat. This was
not Alice sure, and she felt glad to know it, for she would
rather that Alice Johnson should be a shade less lovely
than the young girl before her. How dazzling she was
in her radiant beauty, with all that wealth of chestnut
hair shading her fair brow and falling almost to her waist;
but the soft, dreamy eyes of blue, with their long silken
lashes, were to ’Lina the chief attraction. None could
withstand those eyes, now cast down upon the keys as
if heavy with unshed tears, and now upraised to the
woman beside her who appeared to regard her with a species
of adoration, occasionally laying her hand caressingly
upon the sunny hair, and letting it slide down until
it rested upon the shoulder.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the minutes went by ’Lina grew very impatient at
Alice’s long delay.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I mean to ring,” she said, just as the servant to whom
she had delivered her message appeared.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very haughtily ’Lina asked if he had found Miss Johnson.
“If she’s not in, we don’t care to stay here all
night,” she said, angrily, whereupon she became conscious
that the blue eyes of the lady were fixed inquiringly
upon her, as if wondering how a well bred person could
betray so much ill nature.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Miss Johnson? I beg pardon, I supposed you knew
her and had found her, as she was in here. This is Miss
Johnson,” and the waiter bowed toward the musician,
who, quick as thought seized upon the truth, and springing
to Mrs. Worthington’s side, exclaimed,</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s Mrs. Worthington, I know. Why did you sit
here so long without speaking to me? I am Alice Johnson,”
and overcome with emotions awakened by the sight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>of her mother’s early friend, Alice hid her face with childlike
confidence in Mrs. Worthington’s bosom, and sobbed
for a moment bitterly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then growing calm, she lifted up her head, and smiling
through her tears, said,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Forgive me for this introduction. It is not often I
give way, for I know and am sure it was best and right
that mother should die. I am not rebellious now, but the
sight of you brought it back so vividly. You’ll be my
mother, won’t you?” and the impulsive girl nestled closer
to Mrs. Worthington, looking up into her face with a
confiding affection which won a place for her at once in
Mrs. Worthington’s heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My darling,” she said, winding her arm around her
waist, “as far as I can I will be to you a mother, and
<em>’Lina</em> shall be your sister. This is ’Lina,” and she turned
to ’Lina, who, piqued at having been so long unnoticed,
was frowning gloomily.</p>

<p class='c011'>But ’Lina never met a glance purer or more free from
guile than that which Alice gave her and it disarmed her
at once of all jealousy, making her return the orphan’s
kisses with as much apparent cordiality as they had been
given.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sitting down beside them Alice made many inquiries
concerning Kentucky, startling them with the announcement
that as she had that day received a letter from Col.
Tiffton, who she believed was a friend of theirs, urging
her to come on at once, and spend a few weeks with
him, she had about decided to do so, and only waited for
Mrs. Worthington’s advice ere answering the colonel’s
friendly letter. “They heard from you what were mother’s
plans for my future, and also that I was to meet you
here. They must be very thoughtful people, for they
seem to know that I cannot be very happy here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment, ’Lina and her mother looked aghast, and
neither knew what to say. ’Lina, as usual, was the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>to rally and calculate results. Had Alice been less beautiful
she would have opposed her going to Colonel Tiffton’s
where she might possibly hear something unfavorable of
herself from Ellen, but, as it was, it might be well enough
to get rid of her, as she was sure to prove a most formidable
rival. Thus it was pure selfishness which prompted
her to adopt the most politic course which presented itself
to her mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They were very intimate at Colonel Tiffton’s. She
and Ellen were fast friends. It was very pleasant there
more so than at Spring Bank; and all the objection she
could see to Alice’s going was the fear lest she should become
so much attached to Moss Side, the colonel’s residence,
as to be homesick at Spring Bank.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Against this Alice disclaimed at once. She was not
apt to be homesick. She had made up her mind to be
happy at Spring Bank, and presumed she should.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am so glad you approve my plan, for my heart is
really set on going,” and she turned to Mrs. Worthington,
who had not spoken yet.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not what she had expected, and she hardly knew
what to say, though, of course, “she should acquiesce in
whatever Alice and ’Lina thought best.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If she’s going, I hope she’ll go before Dr. Richards
sees her, though perhaps he knows her already—his
mother lives in Snowdon,” ’Lina thought, and rather
abruptly she asked if Alice knew Dr. Richards, who was
staying at the Union.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice blushed crimson as she replied,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I know him well, and his family, too.</p>

<p class='c011'>“His mother is here,” ’Lina continued, “and I like her
so much. She is very familiar and friendly, don’t you
think so?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice would not tell a lie, and she answered frankly,</p>

<p class='c011'>“She does not bear that name in Snowdon. They
consider her very haughty there. I think you must be a
favorite.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>“Are they very aristocratic and wealthy?” ’Lina asked,
and Alice answered,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Aristocratic, but not wealthy. They were very kind
to me, and the doctor’s sister Anna is one of the sweetest
ladies I ever knew.” Then as if anxious to change the
conversation she spoke of <em>Hugh</em>. Where was he now?
How did he look, and should she like him?</p>

<p class='c011'>’Lina and her mother exchanged rapid glances, and
then, in spite of the look of entreaty visible on Mrs. Worthington’s
face, ’Lina replied,</p>

<p class='c011'>“To be candid with you, Miss Johnson, I’m afraid you
won’t like Hugh. He has many good traits, but I’m sorry
to say we have never succeeded in cultivating him one
particle, so that he is very rough and boorish in his manner,
and will undoubtedly strike you unfavorably. I may
as well tell you of this, as you will probably hear it from
Ellen Tiffton, and must know it when you see him. He
is not popular with the ladies; he hates them all, unless
it is a Mrs. Hastings, whom he took in from the street.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice looked up inquiringly, while ’Lina began to tell
her of Adah. She had not proceeded far, however, when
with a cry of terror she sprang up as a large beetle, attracted
by the light, fastened itself upon her hair.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Worthington was the first to the rescue, while Lulu,
who had listened with flashing eye when <em>Hugh</em> was
the subject of remark, came haggardly, whispering slily to
Alice,</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s a lie she done tell you about Mas’r Hugh. He
ain’t rough nor bad, and we blacks would die for him any
day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice was confounded by this flat contradiction between
mistress and servant, while a faint glimmer of the truth
began to dawn upon her. The “horn-bug” being disposed
of, ’Lina became quiet, and might, perhaps, have taken
up Hugh again, but for a timely interruption in the shape
of Irving Stanley, who had walked up to the Columbian,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>and seeing ’Lina and her mother through the window,
sauntered leisurely into the parlor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, Mr. Stanley,” and ’Lina half rose from her chair
thus intimating that he was to join them. “Miss Johnson,
Mr. Stanley,” and she watched jealously to see what
effect Alice’s beauty would have upon the young man.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was evidently pleased, and this was a sufficient reason
for ’Lina to speak of returning. She would not hasten
Mr. Stanley, she said, but Irving arose at once and
bidding Alice good night, accompanied the ladies back to
Union hall, where Mrs. Richards sat fanning herself industriously,
and watching John with motherly interest as
he sauntered from one group of ladies to another, wondering
what made Saratoga so dull, and where Miss Worthington
had gone. It is not to be supposed that Dr.
Richards cared a fig for Miss Worthington as <em>Miss Worthington</em>.
It was simply her immense figure he admired,
and as, during the evening, he had heard on good authority
that said figure was made up mostly of cotton
growing on some Southern field, the exact locality of
which his informant did not know, he had decided that of
course Miss ’Lina’s fortune was over estimated. Such
things always were, but still she must be wealthy. He
had no doubt of that, and he might as well devote himself
to her as to wait for some one else. Accordingly, the
moment he spied her in the crowd he joined her, asking
if they should not take a little turn up and down the piazza.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wait till I ask mamma’s permission to stay up a little
longer. She always insists upon my keeping such early
hours,” was ’Lina’s very filial and childlike reply as
she walked up to mamma, not to ask permission, but to
whisper rather peremptorily, “Dr. Richards wishes me to
walk with him, and as you are tired you may as well go to
bed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Worthington was tired, but motherlike, she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>thought it would be pleasant to stay where she could see
her daughter walking with Dr. Richards, and then, too,
she wanted to hear the band playing in the court.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I ain’t very tired,” she said. “I begin to feel rested,
and I guess I’ll set a little while with Mrs. Richards
on the sofa yonder. She seems like one of our folks.”</p>

<p class='c011'>’Lina did not care to leave her truthful, matter-of-fact
mother with Mrs. Richards, so she said, rather angrily,</p>

<p class='c011'>“How do you know Mrs. Richards wants you to sit by
her? She has her own set, and you are not much acquainted;
besides, I shall feel easier to know you are up stairs.
Go, do. He’s waiting for me,” and in the black eyes there
was a gleam which Mrs. Worthington always obeyed.</p>

<p class='c011'>With a sigh, and a lingering glance at the comfortable
sofa, where Mrs. Richards sat in solemn state, she left the
comparatively cool parlor, and climbing the weary flights
of stairs, entered her hot, sultry room, and laying her head
upon the table, cried a grieved kind of cry, as she recalled
’Lina’s selfishness and evident desire to be rid of her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She’s ashamed of me,” and the chin quivered as the
white lips whispered it. “She wants me out of the way
for fear I’ll do something to mortify her. Oh, ’Lina, ’Lina,
I’m glad I’ve got one child who is not ashamed of his
mother,” and the tears dropped like rain upon the table, as
Mrs. Worthington remembered Hugh, longing for him so
much, and reproaching herself so bitterly for having consented
to receive Alice Johnson without even consulting
him. “I’ll write to-night,” she said. “I’ll confess the
whole,” and glad of something to occupy her mind, Mrs.
Worthington took out her writing materials, and commenced
the letter, which should have been written long
before.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meantime the doctor and ’Lina were walking up and
down the long piazza, chatting gayly, and attracting much
attention from ’Lina’s loud manner of talking and laughing.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>“By the way, I’ve called on Miss Johnson, at the Columbian,”
she said. “Beautiful, isn’t she?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ra-ather pretty, some would think,” and the doctor
had an uncomfortable consciousness of the refusal, in his
vest pocket.</p>

<p class='c011'>If Alice had told; but no, he knew her better than that.
He could trust her on that score, and so the dastardly
coward affected to sneer at what he called her primness,
charging ’Lina to be careful what she did, if she did
not want a lecture, and asking if there were any ragged
children in Kentucky, as she would not be happy unless
she was running a Sunday school!</p>

<p class='c011'>“She can teach the negroes! Capital!” and ’Lina
laughed so loudly that Mrs. Richards joined them, laughing,
too, at what she did not know, only “Miss Worthington
had such spirits; it did one good; and she wished Anna
was there to be enlivened. Write to her John, won’t
you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>John mentally thought it doubtful. Anna and ’Lina
would never assimilate, and he would rather not have his
pet sister’s opinion to combat until his own was fully made
up.</p>

<p class='c011'>As it was growing rather late Mrs. Richards ere long
expressed a wish to retire, and hoping to see more of
Miss Worthington to-morrow, she bowed good night, and
left the doctor alone with ’Lina.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, somehow, he did not get on well without his mother.
There was nothing in common between himself and
’Lina, except deception. She had read but little, and
only talked well on commonplace matters, of which he
soon grew tired. But she was rich, and perfectly willing
to be admired by him, so he put aside his weariness, and
chatted with her until the parlors were deserted, and the
servants came to extinguish some of the burners.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She had no idea it was so late, or she would not have
staid for anything. He must excuse her. What would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>mamma think?” and bidding him good night, ’Lina hurried
up to where mamma sat waiting for her, the traces
of tears still on her patient face, which looked white and
worn.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In the name of the people, what are you sitting up
for?” was ’Lina’s first remark, followed by a glowing account
of what Dr. Richards had said, and the delightful
time she’d had. “Only play our cards well, and I’m sure
to go home the doctor’s <em>fiancée</em>. The doctor thinks I’m
very rich. So do all the people here. Lulu has told that
I’m an heiress; now don’t you upset it all with your
squeamishness about the truth. Nobody will ask you
how much I’m worth, so you won’t be compelled to a lie
direct. Just keep your own counsel, and leave the rest to
me. Will you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was, as usual, a feeble remonstrance, and then
the weak woman yielded so far as promising to keep
silent was concerned, but she asked timidly,</p>

<p class='c011'>“What will you do if you succeed? He must then
know how you’ve deceived him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Humph! so far, it will be an easy thing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He thinks I am rich, and I am supposed to think he
is. It’s no thanks to him that I know better. But they
are very aristocratic, and family position is sometimes
better than money. On the whole, I prefer it to wealth.
 It will be something in this wise,” she continued; “after
the honeymoon is past, and my lord hears nothing about
bank stock, negroes or lands, he’ll come straight out, and
say, ‘Mrs. Richards, I supposed you were rich!’ while
Mrs. Richards would retort, ‘And I thought you were
rich!’ Don’t you see, it will be an equal thing, and
I shall take my chance.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Meantime the doctor sat in his own room near by,
thinking of ’Lina Worthington, and wishing she were a
little more refined.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where does she get that coarseness?” he thought.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>“Not from her mother, certainly. She seems very gentle
and lady-like. It must be from the Worthingtons,” and
the doctor wondered where he had heard that name before,
and why it affected him rather unpleasantly, bringing
with it memories of Lily. “Poor Lily,” he sighed
mentally. “Your love would have made me a better
man if I had not cast it from me. Dear Lily, the mother
of my child,” and a tear half trembled in his eye lashes,
as he tried to fancy that child, tried to hear the patter
of the little feet running to welcome him home, as
they might have done had he been true to Lily; tried to
hear the baby voice calling him “papa;” to feel the baby
hands upon his face—his bearded face—where the
great tears were standing now. “I <em>did</em> love Lily,” he
murmured; “and had I known of the child I never could
have left her. Oh, Lily, come back to me, come!” and
his arms were stretched out into empty space, as if he fain
would encircle again the girlish form he had so often held
in his embrace.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was very late ere Dr. Richards slept that night, and
the morning found him pale, haggard, and nearly
desperate. Thoughts of Lily all were gone, and in their
place was a fixed determination to follow on in the course
he had marked out, to find him a rich wife, to cast remorse
to the winds, and be as happy as he could. In this state
of feeling ’Lina did not find it hard to keep him at her side,
notwithstanding that <em>Alice</em> herself came down in the
course of the day. Mrs. Richards had not quite given
up all hopes of Alice, and she received her very cordially,
watching closely when the doctor joined them. A
casual observer would not have seen the flush on Alice’s
cheek or the pallor upon his, so soon both came and
passed away, but they did not escape ’Lina’s notice, and
she felt glad when told that she intended starting for
Kentucky on the morrow.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So soon,” she said faintly, feeling that something like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>remonstrance was expected from her, but Alice was not
in the least suspicious, and when next day she stood at the
depot with Mrs. Worthington and ’Lina she never dreamed
how glad the latter was, in knowing that the coming
train would take away one whom she dreaded as a rival.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XVII.<br> <span class='large'>HUGH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>An unexpected turn in Hugh’s affairs made it no longer
necessary for him to remain in the sultry climate of New
Orleans, and just one week from his mother’s departure
from Spring Bank he reached it, expressing unbounded
surprise when he heard from Aunt Eunice where his
mother had gone, and how she had gone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fool and his money soon parted,” Hugh said,</p>

<p class='c011'>“But who is that woman,—the one who sent the
money?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A Mrs. Johnson, an old friend of your mother,”
Aunt Eunice replied, while Hugh looked up quickly,
wondering why the Johnsons should be so continually
thrust upon him, when the only Johnson for whom he
cared was dead years ago.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And the young lady—what about her?” he asked,
while Aunt Eunice told him the little she knew, which
was that Mrs. Johnson wished her daughter to come to
Spring Bank, but she did not know what they had concluded
upon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That she should not come, of course,” Hugh said.
“They had no right to give her a home without my consent,
and I’ve plenty of young ladies at Spring Bank now.
Oh, it was such a relief when I was gone to know that in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>all New Orleans there was not a single hoop annoyed on
my account. I had a glorious time doing as I pleased,”
and helping his aunt to mount the horse which had brought
her to Spring Bank, Hugh returned to the house, which
seemed rather lonely, notwithstanding that he had so often
wished he could once more be alone, just as he was
before his mother came.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the whole, however, he enjoyed his freedom from restraint,
and very rapidly fell back into his old loose way
of living, bringing his dogs into the parlor, and making it
a repository for both his hunting and fishing apparatus.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s splendid to do as I’m a mind to,” he said, one hot
August morning, nearly three weeks after his mother’s departure,
as with his box of worms upon the music stool,
in the little room which ’Lina claimed as exclusively her
own, he sat mending his long fish line, whistling merrily,
and occasionally thrusting back from his forehead the mass
of curling hair, which somewhat obstructed his vision.</p>

<p class='c011'>Around him upon the floor lay half a dozen dogs, some
asleep, and others eyeing his movements curiously, as if
they knew and appreciated what he was doing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There isn’t a finer lot of dogs in Kentucky,” soliloquized
the young man, as he ran his eye over them; “but
wouldn’t my lady at Saratoga rave if she knew I’d taken
her <i><span lang="fr">boudoir</span></i> for a kennel, and kept my bootjack, my blacking
brush, and Sunday shirts all on her piano! Good place
for them, so handy to get at, though I don’t suppose it’s
quite the thing to live so like a savage. Halloo, Mug, what
do <em>you</em> want?” he asked, as a little mulatto girl appeared
in the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Claib done <em>buy</em> you this yer,” and the child handed
him the letter from his mother, which had been to New
Orleans and was forwarded from there.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first of it was full of affection for her boy, and Hugh
felt his heart growing very tender as he read, but when
he reached the point where poor, timid Mrs. Worthington
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>tried to explain about Alice, making a wretched bungle,
and showing plainly how much she was swayed by ’Lina, it
began to harden at once.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What the plague!” he exclaimed as he read on,
“Supposes I remember having heard her speak of her old
school friend, <em>Alice Morton</em>? I don’t remember any such
thing. Her daughter’s name’s <em>Alice</em>—<em>Alice Johnson</em>,”
and Hugh for an instant turned white, so powerfully that
name always affected him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Soon rallying, however, he continued, “Heiress to fifty
thousand dollars. Unfortunate Alice Johnson! better be
lying beside the Golden Haired; but what! actually coming
to Spring Bank, a girl worth fifty thousand, the most
refined, most elegant, most beautiful creature that ever
was born, coming where <em>I</em> am, without my consent, too!
That’s cool upon my word!” and for a moment Hugh
went off in a towering passion, declaring “he wouldn’t
stand it,” and bringing his foot down upon the little bare
toes of Muggins, crouched upon the floor beside him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her loud outcry brought him to himself, and after quieting
her as well as he could, he finished his mother’s letter,
chafing terribly at the thought of a strange young lady being
thrust upon him whether he would have her or not.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is going to Colonel Tiffton’s first, though they’ve
all got the typhoid fever, I hear, and that’s no place for
her. That fever is terrible on Northerners—terrible on
anybody. I’m afraid of it myself, and I wish this horrid
throbbing I’ve felt for a few days would leave my head.
It has a fever feel that I don’t like,” and the young man
pressed his hand against his temples, trying to beat back
the pain which so much annoyed him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just then Colonel Tiffton was announced, his face wearing
an anxious look, and his voice trembling as he told
how sick <em>his Nell</em> was, how sick they all were, and then
spoke of Alice Johnson.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She’s the same girl I told you about the day I bought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>Rocket; some little kin to me, and that makes it queer
why her mother should leave her to you. I knew she
would not be happy at Saratoga, and so we wrote for her
to visit us. She is on the road now, will be here day after
to-morrow, and something must be done. She can’t
come to us, without great inconvenience to ourselves and
serious danger to her. Hugh, my boy, there’s no other
way—she must come to Spring Bank,” and the old colonel
laid his hand on that of Hugh, who looked at him
aghast, but made no immediate reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>He saw at a glance that Alice could not go to Moss Side
with impunity, and if not there she must, of course come
to Spring Bank.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What can I do with her? Oh, Colonel, it makes me
sweat like rain just to think of it, and my head thumps
like a mill-hopper, but, I suppose, there’s no help for it.
You’ll meet her at the depot. You’ll give her an inkling
of what I am. You’ll tell her what a savage she may expect
to find, so she won’t go into fits at sight of me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, yes, I’ll fix it; but, I thought, maybe, you’d have
Aunt Eunice come over till your mother’s return. Women
are gossipping things, and they’d’ talk if she was to
live here alone with you. I tell you, she’s handsome; and
if I’s you, I’d be a little good, that is, I wouldn’t walk the
lots Sundays, but go to church instead.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I always do, sir,” and Hugh spoke quickly, for slowly,
surely, Adah Hastings was influencing him for good,
and more changes than one were already apparent in
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s right,” rejoined the colonel. “Going to church
is well enough for them that like it, which I can’t say I
do, but I’ll see her, I’ll meet her; I’ll tell her. Good-bye,
my boy. Now, I think of it, you look mighty nigh sick.
Your face is as red as a beetle, and eyes kind of blood
shot. The very way my wife looked. Are you sick?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>“No, not sick, but this hot weather affects my head
which feels much as if there were a snare-drum inside.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, that ain’t the symptom. My wife’s felt like a bumble-bee’s
nest. You are all right if you’ll take an emetic,
a good big one, such as will turn your stomach inside out.
Good-bye—Nelly’s awful sick. Struck to her brain last
night. Good-bye. I wouldn’t lose Nell for a farm, if she
is a little gritty,” and wringing Hugh’s hand, the colonel
hurried off, leaving Hugh to his own reflections.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A pretty state of things, and a pretty place to bring
a young lady,” he muttered, glancing ruefully round the
room, and enumerating the different articles he knew
were out of place. “Fish-worms, fish-hooks, fish-lines,
bootjack, boot-blacking, and rifle, to say nothing of the
dogs—and <span class='fss'>ME</span>!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The last was said in a tone as if the me were the most
objectionable part of the whole, as, indeed, Hugh thought
it was.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wonder how I do look to persons wholly unprejudiced!”
Hugh said, and turning to Muggins he asked what
she thought of him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I thinks you berry nice. I likes you berry much,” the
child replied, and Hugh continued, “Yes; but how do I look, I mean? What do I look
like, a dandy or a scarecrow?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Muggins regarded him for a moment curiously, and then
replied, “I’se dunno what kind of thing that dandy is, but I
’members dat yer <em>scarecrow</em> what Claib make out of
mars’r’s trouses and coat, an’ put up in de cherry tree.
I thinks dat look like Mas’r Hugh—yes, very much
like!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hugh laughed long and loud, pinching Mug’s dusky
cheek, and bidding her run away.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pretty good,” he exclaimed, when he was left alone.
“That’s Mug’s opinion. Look like a scarecrow. I mean
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>to see for myself,” and going into the sitting-room, where
the largest mirror was hung, he scanned curiously the
figure which met his view, even taking a smaller glass,
and holding it so as to get a sight of his back. “Tall,
broad-shouldered, straight, well built. My form is well
enough,” he said. “It’s the clothes that bother. I mean
to get some new ones. Then, as to my face,” and Hugh
turned himself around, “I never thought of it before;
but my features are certainly regular, teeth can’t be beaten,
good brown skin, eyes to match, and a heap of curly hair.
I’ll be hanged if I don’t think I’m rather good-looking!”
and with his spirits proportionably raised, Hugh whistled
merrily as he went in quest of Aunt Chloe, to whom he
imparted the startling information that on the next day
but one, a young lady was coming to Spring Bank, and
that, in the meantime, the house must be cleaned from
garret to cellar, and everything put in order for the expected
guest.</p>

<p class='c011'>With growing years, Aunt Chloe had become rather
cross and less inclined to work than formerly, frequently
sighing for the days when “Mas’r John didn’t want no
clarin’ up, but kep’ things lyin’ handy.” With her hands
on her fat hips she stood, coolly regarding Hugh, who
was evidently too much in earnest to be opposed. Alice
was coming, and the house must be put in order.</p>

<p class='c011'>Accordingly, two hours afterwards, there was a strong
smell of soap suds arising from one room, while from
another a cloud of dust was issuing, as Hugh himself bent
over the broom, wondering where all that dirt came from,
inasmuch as his six dogs had only lain there for a few
days!</p>

<p class='c011'>Aunt Eunice, too, was pressed into the service, and
greatly against her will, come to play the hostess for Hugh,
who drove both herself and Aunt Chloe nearly distracted
with his orders and counter orders.</p>

<p class='c011'>Particularly was he interested in what was to be Alice’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>room, sending for Adah to see if it were right, and would
be likely to strike a young lady favorably.</p>

<p class='c011'>The cleaning and arranging was finished at last, and
everything within the house was as neat and orderly
as Aunt Eunice and Adah could make it, even Aunt Chloe
acknowledging that “things was tip-top,” but said “it
was no use settin’ ’em to rights when Mas’r Hugh done
<em>on-sot</em> ’em so quick,” but Hugh promised to do better.
He would turn over a new leaf; so by way of commencement,
on the morning of Alice’s expected arrival he
deliberately rolled up his towel and placed it under his
pillow instead of his night-shirt, which was hung conspicuously
over the washstand. His boots were put
behind the fireboard, his every day hat jammed into the
bandbox where ’Lina kept her winter bonnet, and then,
satisfied that so far as his room was concerned, every
thing was in order, he descended the stairs and went into
the garden to gather fresh flowers with which to adorn
Alice’s room. Hugh was fond of flowers, and two
beautiful bouquets were soon arranged and placed in the
vases brought from the parlor mantel, while Muggins,
who trotted beside him, watching his movements
and sometimes making suggestions, was told to see that
they were freshly watered, and not allowed to stand
where the sun could shine on them, as they might fade
before Miss Johnson came.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You likes her?” and Mug looked inquiringly at him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I never saw her,” he replied, “but I mean to like her
yes,” and Hugh spoke the truth.</p>

<p class='c011'>He could not account for it, but now that it came so
near, there was something enlivening in the prospect of
Alice’s coming. He meant to like her—meant that she
should like him. Not as the Golden Haired might have
done had she lived, but as a friend, a sister. He’d try
his best to win her respect before ’Lina came to prejudice
her against him, if indeed she had not done so already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>and a pang shot through his heart as he thought how possible
it was that Alice Johnson was prepared already to
dislike him. But no, Ad could not be so mean as that,
and Hugh went down to the breakfast which Aunt Eunice
had prepared, and of which he could scarcely taste a
morsel.</p>

<p class='c011'>During the excitement of the last few days, the pain
in his head had in a measure been forgotten, but it had
come back this morning with redoubled force, and the
veins upon his forehead looked almost like bursting with
their pressure of feverish blood. Hugh did not think it
possible for him to be sick, and he tried hard to forget
the giddy, half blinding pain warning him of danger, and
after forcing himself to sip a little coffee in which he
would indulge this morning, he ordered Claib to bring
out the covered buggy, as he was going up to Lexington,
hoping thus to obtain a sight of Alice without being
himself seen, or at least known as Hugh Worthington.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br> <span class='large'>MEETING OF ALICE AND HUGH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Could ’Lina have seen Hugh that morning as he emerged
from a fashionable tailor’s shop, she would scarcely
have recognized him, so greatly was he improved by the
entire new suit in which he had been indulging, and
which gave him so stylish an appearance that Hugh for a
moment felt uncomfortable, and was glad that one whole
hour must elapse before the cars from Cincinnati were due
as he could thus become a little accustomed to himself
and not be so painfully conscious. The hour passed rapidly
away, and its close found Hugh waiting at the terminus
of the Lexington and Cincinnati Railroad. A moment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>more, and the broad platform was swarming with
passengers, conspicuous among whom were an old lady
and a young, both dressed in black, both closely veiled
and both entire strangers, as was evinced by their anxiety
to know what they were next to do, or where to go.</p>

<p class='c011'>“These are ours,” the young lady said, pointing to a
huge pile of trunks, distinctly marked “A. J.,” and Hugh
drew so near to her that her long black veil swept against
his coat, as she held out her checks in her ungloved hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hugh noticed the hand, saw that it was very small and
white and fat, but the face he could not see, and he looked
in vain for the magnificent hair about which even his
mother had waxed eloquent, and which was now put
plainly back, so that not a vestige of it was visible. Still
Hugh felt sure that this was Alice Johnson, so sure that
when he had ascertained the hotel where she would wait
for the Frankfort train, he followed on, and entering the
back parlor, the door of which was partly closed, sat
down as if he too were a traveller, waiting for the train.
It never occurred to Hugh that he was acting the part of
an eaves-dropper, so anxious he was to see Alice without
being seen, and taking up an old paper, he pretended to
be greatly interested in its columns, which, for any information
he gleaned from them, might as well have been
bottom side up.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meantime, in the room adjoining, Alice divested herself
of her dusty wrappings, and taking out her combs
and brushes, began to arrange her hair, talking the while
to Densie, her nurse, reclining on the sofa. How the tones
of that voice thrilled on Hugh’s ear like some forgotten
music, heard he knew not when or where, and how still
he sat, when at last the conversation turned upon his
mother and ’Lina, about whom Alice talked freely, never
dreaming of Hugh’s proximity.</p>

<p class='c011'>It would seem that Alice’s own luxuriant tresses suggested
her first remark, for she said to Densie, “That
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>Miss Worthington had beautiful hair, so glossy, and so
wavy, too. I wonder she never curls it. It looks as
if she might.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A smile fitted over Hugh’s face as he thought of the
tags, and wondered what Alice would say could she see
Ad early in the morning, with a red silk handkerchief,
tied round her head by way of covering what he called
tags, “It would take a steam engine to make Ad’s hair
curl,” he said to himself, while Alice continued, “I
did not like her eyes; they were too much like coals
of fire, when they flashed angrily on that poor Lulu, who
evidently was not well posted in the duties of a waiting-maid.
If mother had not so decided, I should shrink
from being an inmate of Mrs. Worthington’s family. I
like her very much, but I am afraid I shall not get on
with ’Lina.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know you won’t. I honor your judgment,” was
Hugh’s mental comment, while Alice went on.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And what she told me of her brother was not calculated
to impress me favorably.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Nervously Hugh’s hands grasped each other, and he
could distinctly hear the beating of his heart as he
leaned forward so as not to lose a single word.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She seemed trying to prepare me for him by telling
how rough he was; how little he cared for etiquette; and
how constantly he mortified her with his uncouth manners.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The perspiration fairly dripped from Hugh’s flushed
face, as with clenched fist and a muttered curse upon his
white lips he listened while Alice went on.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mother never dreamed he was such a man. Indeed,
he was prepossessed in his favor, remembering his distress
when he lost his little sister, who was mysteriously
abducted by her father, and as mysteriously returned.
He was a fine, handsome boy, mother said, and she thought
I would like him. Bad as he may be, he is evidently a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>favorite with his negroes, for Lulu resented what her mistress
said of him, and, in her peculiar way, told me it was
false.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Heaven bless Lulu!” Hugh mentally exclaimed.
“I’ll set her free the day that she’s eighteen; but Ad, oh,
must it go on thus? Will she always be a thorn to
me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice did not hear the sigh of pain or see the mournful
look which stole over Hugh’s face. She did not even suspect
his presence, and she continued to speak of Spring
Bank, wondering if Hugh would be there before his mother
returned, half hoping he would not, as she rather dreaded
meeting him, although she meant to like him if she
could.</p>

<p class='c011'>Poor Hugh! How he winced and trembled, and wished
he was away. How madly the hot blood poured through
his swollen veins, and how fast the pain increased about
his temples, while little sparks of fire danced before his
eyes. Alice should have her wish, he said bitterly. She
should not find Spring Bank encumbered with its hateful
owner. ’Lina should not find him there when she returned,
she should never blush again for him, for he would go
away. With a stifled, noiseless moan, Hugh rose to leave
the room, glancing once toward the narrow opening in
the folding-doors. Then, as if petrified with what he saw,
he stood riveted to the spot, his quivering lips apart, his
head bent forward, and his eyes almost black, so strangely
bright they grew.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice’s long, bright hair, was arranged at last, and the
soft curls fell about her face, giving to it the same look it
had worn in childhood—the look which was graven on
Hugh’s heart, as with a pencil of fire; the look he never
had forgotten through all the years which had come and
gone since first it shone on him; the look he had never hoped
to see again, so sure was he that it had been quenched
by the waters of Lake Erie. Alice’s face was turned fully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>toward him. Through the open window at her back the
August sunlight streamed, falling on her chestnut hair, and
tinging it with the yellow gleam which Hugh remembered
so well. For an instant the long lashes shaded the fair
round cheek, and then were uplifted, disclosing the eyes
of blue, which, seen but once, could never be mistaken,
and Hugh was not mistaken. One look of piercing scrutiny
at the face unconsciously confronting him, one mighty
throb, which seemed to bear away his very life, and
then Hugh knew the grave had given up its dead.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was not lost for she stood there before him. She
whose memory had saved him oftentimes from sin. She,
for whom he would almost lay him down and die. <em>She,
the Golden Haired.</em> Changed, it is true, from a lovely
child of thirteen to a far more lovely woman, but not past
his recognition. The golden locks his hands had touched
but once, and that when the mad waves were dashing over
them, had put on a richer, darker tinge, and fell in
heavier masses about her brow and neck. The face, too,
with its piquant nose, was more mature; only the eyes
were wholly unchanged. In them, the same truthful loving
light was shining, and the curve of the silken lashes
was just the same as when they drooped coyly, beneath
the compliment which the tall youth had paid them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Golden Hair had come back, but, alas, prejudiced against
him. She hoped he might be gone. She would be happier
if he never crossed her path. “And I never, never
will,” Hugh thought, as he staggered from the room and
sought a small outer court, whose locality he knew, and
where he could be alone to think.</p>

<p class='c011'>The throbbing in his head had increased in violence,
and what before were gleams of fire dancing before his
eyes, were now like rings of blood, of which the sultry
air seemed full. How sick and faint he was sitting there
in that dingy court, with his head upon his hands, half
wishing he might die, and so trouble no one any more.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>He felt that the dearest treasure he had ever possessed
was wrested from him—that in losing Golden Hair’s
good opinion he had lost all that made life desirable.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Adaline,” he murmured, “what made you so
cruel to me? I would not have served you so.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a roll of wheels before the door, and Hugh
knew by the sound that it was the carriage for the cars.
She was going. They would never meet again, Hugh
said, and she would never know that the youth who tried
to save her life was the same for whose coming they
would wait and watch in vain at Spring Bank—the Hugh
for whom his mother would weep awhile; and for whose
dark fate even Ad might feel a little sorry. She was not
wholly depraved—she had some sisterly feeling, and his
loss would waken it to life. They would appreciate him
after he was gone, and the poor heart which had known
so little love throbbed joyfully, as Hugh thought of being
loved at last even by the selfish ’Lina.</p>

<p class='c011'>Fiercely the August sun poured down into that pent
up court, creating a drowsiness which Hugh did not care
to shake off. Unconsciousness was welcome at any price,
and leaning his aching head against the damp, mouldy
wall, he fell at last into a heavy sleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meantime Alice and Densie proceeded on their way to
the Big Spring station, where Col. Tiffton was waiting for
them, according to his promise. There was a shadow in
the colonel’s good-humored face, and a shadow in his
heart. His idol, Nellie, was very sick, while added to
this was the terrible certainty that he alone must pay a
$10,000 note on which he had foolishly put his name, because
Harney had preferred it. He was talking with
Harney when the cars came up, and the villain, while expressing
regret that the colonel should be compelled to
pay so much for what he never had received, had said
with a relentless smile, “But it’s not my fault, you know
I can’t afford to lose it.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>From that moment the colonel felt he was a ruined man,
but he would not allow himself to appear at all discomposed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wait awhile,” he said; “do nothing till my Nell lives
or dies,” and with a sigh as he thought how much dearer
to him was his youngest daughter than all the farms in
Woodford, he went forward to meet Alice, just appearing
upon the platform.</p>

<p class='c011'>The colonel explained to Alice why she must go to
Spring Bank, adding by way of consolation, that she
would not be quite as lonely now Hugh was at home.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Hugh</em> at home!” and Alice shrank back in dismay,
feeling for a moment that she could not go there.</p>

<p class='c011'>But there was no alternative, and after a few tears
which she could not repress, she said, timidly,</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is this Hugh? What kind of a man, I mean?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She could not expect the colonel to say anything bad
of him, but she was not prepared for his frank response.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The likeliest chap in Kentucky. Nothing dandified
about him, to be sure. Wears his trouser legs in his boots
as often as any way, and don’t stand about the very latest
cut of his coat, but he’s got a heart bigger than an <em>ox</em>—yes,
big as <em>ten</em> oxen! I’d trust him with my life, and know
it was safe as his own. You’ll like Hugh— Nell does.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The colonel never dreamed of the comfort his words
gave Alice, or how they changed her feelings with regard
to one whom she had so dreaded to meet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There ’tis; we’re almost there,” the colonel said at
last, as they turned off from the highway, and leaning
forward Alice caught sight of the roofs and dilapidated
chimneys of Spring Bank. “’Tain’t quite as fixey as
Yankee houses, that’s a fact, but we that own niggers never
do have things so smarted up,” the colonel said, guessing
how the contrast must affect Alice, who felt so desolate
and homesick as she drew up in front of what, for a
time at least, was to be her home.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>At a single glance she took in every peculiarity, from the
mossy, decaying eaves, where the swallows were twittering
their songs, to the group of negroes ranged upon the
piazza, staring curiously at her as she alighted, followed
by Densie Densmore. Where was Hugh? Surely he
should be there to greet her, and with a return of something
like the olden terror Alice looked nervously in all
directions, as if expecting some vampyre to start out and
seize her. But only Aunt Eunice, in trim white cap and
black silk apron, appeared, welcoming the strangers with
a motherly kindness, which went to Alice’s heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>Aunt Eunice saw that she looked very tired, and asked
if she would not go at once to her room and lie down.
Glad to be alone, Alice followed her through the hall and
up the stairs to the pleasant chamber in which Hugh had
been so interested.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are tired and homesick, too, I guess,” Aunt Eunice
said, “but you’ll get over it by and by. Spring Bank is a
pleasant place, and if Hugh could he’d make it a handsome
one. He has the taste.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where is Hugh?” Alice asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>Aunt Eunice would not say he had gone to Lexington
for the sake, perhaps, of seeing her, so she replied,</p>

<p class='c011'>“He went to town this morning, but he’ll be back pretty
soon. He has done his best to make it pleasant for
you. <em>You’ll like Hugh.</em> There, try to go to sleep,” and
kind Aunt Eunice bustled from the room just as Densie
entered it, together with Aunt Chloe. The old negress
was evidently playing the hostess to Densie, for she was
talking quite loud, and all about “Mas’r Hugh.” “Pity
he wasn’t thar, ’twould seem so different; ’tain’t de same
house without him. <em>You’ll like Mas’r Hugh</em>,” and she,
too glided from the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>Was this the password at Spring Bank, “You’ll like
Mas’r Hugh?” It would seem so, for when at last Hannah
brought up the waffles and tea, which Aunt Eunice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>had prepared, she sat down her tray, and after a few inquiries
concerning Alice’s head, which was now aching
sadly, she, too, launched forth into a panegyric on Mas’r
Hugh, ending, as the rest had done, “You’ll like Mas’r
Hugh.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice began to believe she should, and with a silent
thanksgiving that the great bugbear of Spring Bank was
likely to prove so harmless, she waited and listened for
any sounds which might herald Hugh’s approach. But
the summer evening waned and the summer night closed
quietly around Spring Bank, without bringing its master
home. One by one the negroes went to their cabins, and
when at last the clock struck twelve, Aunt Eunice, who
had been waiting for her boy, lighted her tallow candle
and stole noiselessly to her room, where by the open window
she sat for a long, long time, listening to the howl of
Rover, who, sat upon the steps and filled the air with his
lonely cries. Aunt Eunice was not superstitious, but Rover’s
howl sounded painfully in her ear, and when at last
she crept slowly to her pillow there was a dread fear at
her heart lest something had befallen Hugh.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XIX.<br> <span class='large'>ALICE AND MUGGINS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Had an angel appeared suddenly to the blacks at Spring
Bank they would not have been more surprised or delighted
than they were with Alice when she came down to breakfast
looking so beautifully in her muslin wrapper, with a simple
white blossom and geranium leaf twined among her flowing
curls, and an expression of content upon her childish face
which said that she had resolved to make the best of the
place to which Providence had so clearly led her for some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>wise purpose of his own. She had arisen early and explored
the premises in quest of the spots of sunshine
which she knew were there as well as elsewhere, and she
had found them, too, in the grand old elms and maples
which shaded the wooden building, in the clean, grassy
lawn and the running brook, in the well kept garden of
flowers, and in the few choice volumes arranged in the old
bookcase at one end of the hall. Who read those books?
Not ’Lina, most assuredly, for Alice’ reminiscences of
her were not of the literary kind; nor yet Mrs. Worthington,
kind, gentle creature as she seemed to be. Who
then but Hugh could have pored over those pages? And
with a thrill of joy she was turning from the corner, when
the patter of little naked feet was heard upon the stairs,
and a bright mulatto child, apparently seven or eight years
old, appeared, her face expressive of the admiration with
which she regarded Alice, who asked her name.</p>

<p class='c011'>Curtesying very low the child replied,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I dunno, missus; Mas’r Hugh don nickname me <em>Muggins</em>,
and every folks do that now. You know Mas’r Hugh?
He done <em>rared</em> when he read you’s comin’; do this way
with his boot, ‘By George, Ad will sell the old hut yet without
’sultin’ me,’” and the little darkey’s fist came down
upon the window sill in apt imitation of her master.</p>

<p class='c011'>A crimson flush overspread Alice’s face as she wondered
if it were possible that the arrangements concerning her
coming there had been made without reference to Hugh’s
wishes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It may be; he was away,” she sighed; then feeling an
intense desire to know more, and being only a woman
and mortal, she said to <em>Muggins</em>, walking round her in
circles, with her fat arms folded upon her bosom, “Your
master did not know I was coming till he returned from
New Orleans and found his mother’s letter?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who tole you dat ar?” and Muggin’s face was perfectly
comical in its bewilderment at what she deemed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>Alice’s foreknowledge. “But dat’s so. I hear Aunt Chloe
say so, and how’t was right mean in Miss ’Lina. <em>I hate
Miss ’Lina! Phew-ew!</em>” and Muggins’ face screwed itself
into a look of such perfect disgust that Alice could not
forbear laughing outright.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You should not hate any one, my child,” she said, while
Muggins rejoined,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can’t help it—none of us can; she’s so—mean—and
so—low-flung, Claib says. She hain’t any <em>bizzens</em> orderin’
us round nuther, and I will hate her!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, Muggins, the Bible teaches us to love those who
treat us badly, who are <em>mean</em>, as you say.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who’s he?” and Muggins looked up quickly. “I never
hearn tell of him afore, or, yes, I has. Thar’s an old
wared out book in Mas’r Hugh’s chest, what he reads in
every night, and oncet when I axes him what was it, he
say ‘It’s a Bible, Mug.’ Dat’s what he calls me for short,
<em>Mug</em>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a warm spot now in Alice’s heart for Hugh.
A man who read his Bible every night could not be very
bad, and she blessed Mug for the cheering news, little
dreaming whose Bible it was Hugh read, or whose curl
of yellow hair served him for a book mark. Mug’s prying
eyes had ferreted that out, too, and delighted with so
attentive a listener as Alice, she continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dat’s the thing, then, what teaches us to love the hatefuls.
Mug don’t want to read him, though I reckon Mas’r
Hugh done grow some better, for he hain’t been hoppin’
mad this good while, like he got at Miss ’Lina ’bout that
dress and Miss Adah. He was awful then. He <em>swared</em>,
he did.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Muggins, you must not tell me these things of your
master. It is not right,” Alice interposed and Muggins
replied,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, then, I done took ’em back. He didn’t swared,
but he do read the Bible, and he do kiss dat curl of yaller
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>har what he keeps in it. I see him through the do’
and I hear him whisper ’bout Golden Har or somethin’
mighty like him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice was in a tremor of distress. She knew Muggins
ought not to disclose Hugh’s secrets, and she saw no way
to stop her except by sending her away, and this she was
about to do when a new idea was suggested to her. Possibly
she could keep her from repeating the story to others,
so she asked if “Muggins had ever told this about the
curl to any one else.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nobody but Chloe, and she <em>boxt</em> my ears so that I done
forgot till I see you, and that har of your’n makes me
’member the one Mas’r Hugh kissed—real smackin’ loud,
so,” and Muggins illustrated on her own hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, then,” Alice said, “promise you will not. Your
master would be very angry to know you watched him
through the door, and then told what you saw. You
must be a good girl, Muggins. God will love you if you
do. Do you ever pray?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“More times I do, and more times when I’se sleepy I
don’t,” was Muggins’ reply, her face brightening up as
she continued, “But I can tell you who does—Miss Adah
and Uncle Sam, over dar in the cornfield. They prays,
both of ’em, and Sam, is powerful, I tell you. I hears
him at the black folk’s meetin’. <em>Hollers</em>—oh! oh!” and
Muggins stopped her ears, as if even the memory of Sam’s
prayers were deafening; but if the ears stopped, the tongue
was just as busy as the talkative child went on:
“Sam prays for Mas’r Hugh, that God would fetch him
right some day, and Miss Adah say God will, ’case she say
he see and hear everyting. Mug don’t believe dat; can’t
cheat dis chile, ’case if he hear and see, what made him
hold still dat time Miss ’Lina <em>licked</em> me for telling Mas’r
Harney how’t she done up her har at night in fourteen little
braids, and slep’ in great big cap to make it look wavy
like yourn. Does you twist yourn up in tails?” and as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>she had all along been aching to do, Muggins laid her
hands on the luxuriant tresses, which Alice assured her
were not done up in tails.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here was a spot where Alice might do good; this half-heathen,
but sprightly, African child needed her, and she
began already to get an inkling of her mission to Kentucky.
She was pleased with <em>Muggins</em>, and suffered the
little dusky hands to caress her curls as long as they
pleased, while she questioned her of the bookcase and its
contents, whose was it, ’Lina’s or Hugh’s?</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mas’r Hugh’s in course. Miss ’Lina <em>can’t read</em>!” was
Muggins’ reply, which Alice fully understood.</p>

<p class='c011'>’Lina was no reader, while Hugh was, it might be, and
she continued to speak of him. Did he read evenings to
his mother, or did ’Lina play to them?</p>

<p class='c011'>“More’n we wants, a heap!” and Muggins spoke scornfully.
“We can’t bar them things she thumps out. Now
we likes Mas’r Hugh’s the best—got good voice, sing
Dixie, oh, splendid! Mas’r Hugh loves flowers, too.
Tend all them in the garden.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did he?” and Alice spoke with great animation, for
she had supposed that ’Lina’s or at least Mrs. Worthington’s
hands had been there.</p>

<p class='c011'>But it was all Hugh, and in spite of what Muggins
had said concerning his aversion to her coming there
she felt a great desire to see him. She could understand
in part why he should be angry at not having been consulted,
but he was over that, she was sure from what Aunt
Eunice said, and if he were not, it behooved her to try
her best to remove any wrong impression he might have
formed of her. “He shall like me,” she thought; “not
as he must like that golden haired maiden, whose existence
this sprite of a negro has discovered, but as a friend,
or sister,” and a softer light shone in Alice’s blue eyes,
as she foresaw in fancy Hugh gradually coming to like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>her, to be glad that she was there, and to miss her when
she was gone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What time did he come home last night?” she asked,
feeling more disappointed than she cared to confess at
Muggin’s answer that, “he hadn’t come at all!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice was but human, and it must be confessed that she
had made her toilet that morning with a slight reference
to Hugh’s eyes, wondering if he liked white, and wondering,
too, if he liked flowers, when she placed the wax
ball in her hair.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are sorry?” Mug said, interpreting her looks
aright.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I am sorry. I want to see your master, Hugh.
I mean to like him very much.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll tell him dat ar,” thought Muggins. “I ’members
how’t he say oncet that nobody done love him,” and, spying
Claib in the distance, the little tattler ran off to tell
him how beautiful the new missus was, and how she let
her smooth her <em>har</em>, all she wanted to.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XX.<br> <span class='large'>POOR HUGH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Could Hugh have known the feelings with which Alice
Johnson already regarded him, and the opinion she had
expressed to Muggins, it would perhaps have stilled the
fierce throbbings of his heart, which sent the hot blood
so swiftly through his veins, and made him from the first
delirious. They had found him in the quiet court just
after the sun setting, and his uncovered head was already
wet with the falling dew, and the profuse perspiration
induced by his long, heavy sleep. He was well known at
the hotel, and measures were immediately taken for apprising
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>his family of the sudden illness, and for removing him
to Spring Bank as soon as possible.</p>

<p class='c011'>Breakfast was not yet over at Spring Bank, and Aunt
Eunice was wondering what could have become of Hugh,
when from her position near the window she discovered
a horseman riding across the lawn at a rate which betokened
some important errand. Alice spied him too, and the
same thought flashed over both herself and Aunt Eunice.
“Something had befallen Hugh.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice was the first upon the piazza, where she stood
waiting till the rider came up,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you Miss Worthington?” he asked, doffing his
soil hat, and feeling a thrill of wonder at sight of her
marvellous beauty.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Miss Worthington is not at home,” she said, going
down the steps and advancing closer to him, “but I can
take your message. Is any thing the matter with Mr.
Worthington?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Aunt Eunice had now joined her, and listened breathlessly
while the young man told of Hugh’s illness, which
threatened to be the prevailing fever.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They were bringing him home,” he said—“were now
on the way, and he had ridden in advance to prepare
them for his coming.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Aunt Eunice seemed literally stunned and wholly incapable
of action, while the negroes howled dismally for Mas’r
Hugh, who, Chloe said, was sure to die.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice alone was calm and capable of acting. A room
must be prepared, and somebody must direct, but to find
the somebody was a most difficult matter. Chloe couldn’t,
Hannah couldn’t, Aunt Eunice couldn’t, and consequently
it all devolved upon herself. Throwing aside the feelings
of a stranger she summoned Densie to her aid, and then
went quietly to work. By dint of questioning Muggins,
who hovered near her constantly, she ascertained which
was Hugh’s sleeping room, and entered it to reconnoiter.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>It was the most uncomfortable room in the house, for
during two thirds of the day the hot sun poured down upon
the low roof, heating the walls like an oven, and rendering
it wholly unfit for a sick man. Hugh must not be put
there, and after satisfying herself that her own chamber
was the coolest and most convenient in the house, Alice
came to a decision, and regardless of her own personal
comfort, set to work to remove, with Densie’s help, her
various articles of luggage.</p>

<p class='c011'>By this time Aunt Eunice had rallied a little, and hearing
what Alice was doing, offered a faint remonstrance.
Hugh would never be reconciled to taking Miss Johnson’s
room, she said, but Alice silenced every objection, and
Aunt Eunice yielded the point, feeling intuitively that
the sceptre had passed from her hand into a far more
efficient one. The pleasant chamber, in which only yesterday
morning Hugh himself had been so interested, was
ready at last. The wide north windows were open, and
the soft summer air came stealing in, lifting the muslin
curtains which Alice had looped back, blowing across the
snowy pillows which Alice’s hands had arranged, and
kissing the half withered flowers which Hugh had picked
for Alice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll done get some fresher ones. Mas’r Hugh love the
posies,” Muggins said, as she saw Alice bending over the
vase.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor Hugh!” Alice sighed, as Muggins ran off for the
flowers, which she brought to Miss Johnson, who arranged
them into beautiful bouquets for the sick man now just
at the gate. Alice saw the carriage as it stopped, and saw
the tall form which the men were helping up the walk;
and that was all she saw, so busily was she occupied in
hushing the outcries of the excitable negroes, while Hugh
was carried to the room designated by Densie, and into
which he went unwillingly. “It was not his den,” he
said, drawing back with a bewildered look; “his was hot,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>and close, and dingy, while this was nice and cool—a
room such as women had; there must be a mistake,” and
he begged of them to take him away.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, ho, my poor boy. This is right; Miss Johnson
said you must come here just because it is cool and nice.
You’ll get well so must faster,” and Aunt Eunice’s tears
dropped on Hugh’s flushed face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Miss Johnson!” and the wild eyes looked up eagerly
at her. “Who is she? Oh, yes, I know, I know,” and a
moan came from his lips as he whispered, “Does she know
I’ve come? Does it make her hate me worse to see me in
such a plight? Ho, Aunt Eunice, put your ear down close
while I tell you something. Ad said—you know Ad—she
said I was—I was—I can’t tell you what she said
for this buzzing in my head. Am I very sick, Aunt Eunice?”
and about the chin there was a quivering motion,
which betokened a ray of consciousness, as the brown eyes
scanned the kind, motherly face bending over him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Hugh, you are very sick,” and Aunt Eunice’s
tears dropped upon the face of her boy, so fearfully changed
since yesterday.</p>

<p class='c011'>He wiped them away himself, and looked inquiringly
at her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Am I so sick that it makes you cry? Is it the fever
I’ve got?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Hugh, the fever,” and Aunt Eunice bowed her
face upon his burning hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment he lay unconscious, then raising himself
up, he fixed his eyes piercingly upon her, and whispered
hoarsely,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Aunt Eunice, I shall die! I have never been sick in
my life; and the fever goes hard with such. I shall surely
die. It’s been days in coming on, and I thought to
fight it off, I don’t want to die. I’m not prepared,” and
in the once strong man’s voice there was a note of fear,
such as only the dread of death could have wrung from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>him. “Aunt Eunice,” and the voice was now a kind of
sob, “tell Adah and Sam to pray. I shall lose my senses
soon, they go and come so fast; and tell Miss Johnson,
(I’ve heard that she too prays) tell her when she watches
by me, as perhaps she will, tell her to pray, though I do
not hear it, pray that I need not die, not yet, not yet. Oh
if I had prayed sooner, prayed before,” and the white lips
moved as if uttering now the petitions too long left unsaid.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the mind wandered again, and Hugh talked of
Alice and Golden Hair, not as one and the same, but as
two distinct individuals, and then he spoke of his mother.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’ll send for her; and if I’m dead when she comes,
tell her I tried to be a dutiful son, and was always sorry
when I failed. Tell her I love my mother more than she
ever dreamed; and tell <em>Ad</em>——” Here he paused, and
the forehead knit itself into great wrinkles, so intense
were his thoughts. “Tell Ad—no, not tell her anything.
She’ll be glad when I’m dead, and trip back from my grave
so gaily!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He was growing terribly excited now, and Aunt Eunice
hailed the coming of the doctor with delight. Hugh
knew him, offering his pulse and putting out his tongue
of his own accord. The doctor counted the rapid pulse,
numbering even then 130 per minute, noted the rolling
eyeballs and the dilation of the pupils, felt the fierce throbbing
of the swollen veins upon the temple, and then shook
his head. Half conscious, half delirious, Hugh watched
him nervously, until the great fear at his heart found utterance
in words,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Must I die?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We hope not. We’ll do what we can to save you.
Don’t think of dying, my boy,” was the physician’s reply,
as he turned to Aunt Eunice, and gave out the medicine,
which must be most carefully administered.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>Too much agitated to know just what he said, Aunt
Eunice listened as one who heard not, noticing which
the doctor said,</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are not the right one to take these directions.
Is there nobody here less nervous than yourself? Who
was that young lady standing by the door when I came
in. The one in white, I mean, with such a quantity of
curls.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Miss Johnson—our visitor. She can’t do anything,”
Aunt Eunice replied, trying to compose herself enough to
know what she was doing.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the doctor thought differently. Something of a
physiognomist, he had been struck with the expression of
Alice’s face, and felt sure that she would be a more efficient
aid than Aunt Eunice herself. “I’ll speak to her,” he said,
stepping to the hall. But Alice was gone. She had stood
by the sick room door long enough to hear Hugh’s impassioned
words concerning his probable death—long
enough to hear him ask that she might pray for him; and
then she stole away to where no ear, save that of God,
could hear the earnest prayer that Hugh Worthington
might live—or that dying, there might be given him a
space in which to grasp the faith, without which the grave
is dark and terrible indeed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m glad I came here now,” she whispered, as she rose
from her knees. “I know my work in part, and may God
give me strength to do it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is you talkin’ to God, Miss Alice?” said a little voice,
and Mug’s round black face looked cautiously in.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Muggins, I was talking to God.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’d mighty well like to know what you done say,” was
Mug’s next remark, as she ventured across the threshold.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I asked him to make your Master Hugh well again, or
else take him to heaven,” was Alice’s reply; whereupon
the great tears gathered in the eyes of the awe-struck
child, who continued,</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>“I wish I could ax God, too. Would he hear a black
nigger like me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Muggins, God hears everybody, black as well as
white.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I jest go down in the woods whar Claib can’t
see me, and ax Him to cure Mas’r Hugh, not take him to
heaven. I don’t like dat ar.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was in vain that Alice tried to explain. Muggins’
mind grasped but one idea. Master Hugh must live; and
she started to leave the room, turning back to ask, “if
God could hear all the same if she got down by the brook
where the bushes were so thick that Claib nor nobody
could find her if they tried.” Assured that he would, she
stole from the house, and seeking out the hiding place
kneeled down upon the tall, rank grass, and with her face
hidden in the roots of the alder bushes, she asked in her
peculiar way, that “God would not take Mas’r Hugh to
heaven, but give him a heap of doctor’s stuff, and make
him well again,” promising, if he did, that “She would
not steal any more jam from the jars in the cellar, or any
more sugar from the bowl in the closet.” She could not
remember for whose sake Alice had bidden her pray, so
she said, “for the sake of him what miss done tell me,”
adding quickly, “Miss Alice, I mean, not Miss ’Lina!
Bah!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Muggins intended no irreverence, nor did she dream
that she was guilty of any. She only felt that she had
done her best, and into her childish heart there crept a
trusting faith that God had surely heard, and Mas’r Hugh
would live.</p>

<p class='c011'>And who shall say that He did not hear and answer Muggin’s
prayer, made by the running brook, where none but
Him could hear?</p>

<p class='c011'>Meantime, the Hugh for whom the prayer was made
had fallen into a heavy sleep, and Aunt Eunice noiselessly
left the room, meeting in the hall with Alice, who asked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>permission to go in and sit by him until he awoke. Aunt
Eunice consented, and with noiseless footsteps Alice advanced
into the darkened room, and after standing still
for a moment to assure herself that Hugh was really sleeping,
stole softly to his bedside and bent down to look at
him, starting quickly at the resemblance to somebody seen
before. Who was it? Where was it? she asked herself,
her brain a labyrinth of bewilderment as she tried in vain
to recall the time or place a face like this reposing upon
the pillow had met her view. But her efforts were all in
vain to bring the past to mind, and thinking she was mistaken
in supposing she had ever seen him before, she sat
softly down beside him.</p>

<p class='c011'>How disappointed Alice was in him, asking herself if
it could be the dreaded Hugh. There was surely nothing
to be dreaded from him now, and as if she had been his
sister she wiped the sweat drops from his face.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a tremulous motion of the lids, a contracting
of the muscles about the mouth, and then the eyes
opened for a moment, but the stare he gave to Alice was
wholly meaningless. He evidently had no thought of her
presence, though he murmured the name “Golden Hair,”
and then fell away again into the heavy stupor which continued
all the day. Alice would not leave him. She
had heard him say, “When she watches by me as perhaps
she will, though I may not know her,” and that was sufficient
to keep her at his side. She was accustomed to sickness,
she said, and in spite of Aunt Eunice’s entreaties,
she sat by his pillow, bathing his burning hands, holding
the cooling ice upon his head, putting it to his lips, and
doing those thousand little acts which only a kind womanly
heart can prompt, and silently praying almost constantly
as Hugh had said she must.</p>

<p class='c011'>There were others than Alice praying for Hugh that
summer afternoon, for Muggins had gone from the brook
to the cornfield, startling Adah with the story of Hugh’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>sickness, and then launching out into a glowing description
of the new miss, “with her white gownd and curls as
long as Rocket’s tail.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She talked with God, too,” she said, “like what you
does, Miss Adah. She axes him to make Mas’r Hugh well,
and He will, won’t He?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I trust so,” Adah answered, her own heart going silently
up to the Giver of life and health, asking, if it were
possible, that her noble friend might be spared.</p>

<p class='c011'>Old Sam, too, with streaming eyes stole out to his
bethel by the spring, and prayed for the dear “Massah
Hugh” lying so still at Spring Bank, and insensible to all
the prayers going up in his behalf.</p>

<p class='c011'>How terrible that deathlike stupor was, and the physician,
when later in the afternoon he came again, shook his
head sadly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’d rather see him rave till it took ten men to hold
him,” he said, feeling the wiry pulse which were now beyond
his count.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is there nothing that will rouse him?” Alice asked,
“no name of one he loves more than another?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The doctor answered “no; love for woman-kind, save
as he feels it for his mother or his sister, is unknown to
Hugh Worthington.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Alice did not think so. The only words he had
whispered since she sat there, together with Muggins’
story of the Bible and the curl, would indicate that far
down in Hugh’s heart, where the world had never seen,
there was hidden a mighty, undying love for some one.
How she wished they were alone, that she might whisper,
that name in his ear, but with the doctor there, and Aunt
Eunice and Densie close at hand, she dared not, lest she
should betray the secret she had no right to possess.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll speak to him of his mother,” she said, and
moistening with ice the lips which were now of a purple
hue she said to him softly,</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>“Mr. Worthington.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Call him Hugh,” Aunt Eunice whispered, and Alice
continued,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hugh, do you know I’m speaking to you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She bent so low that her breath lifted the rings of hair
from his forehead, and her auburn curls swept his cheek.
There was a quivering of the lids, a scarcely perceptible
moan, and thus encouraged, Alice continued,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hugh, shall I write to your mother? She’s gone, you
know, with ’Lina.”</p>

<p class='c011'>To this there was no response, and taking advantage
of something outside which had suddenly attracted her
three auditors to the window, Alice said again softly, lest
she should be heard,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hugh, shall I call <em>Golden Haired</em>?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, yes, oh yes,” and the heavy lids unclosed at once,
while the eyes, in which there was no ray of consciousness,
looked wistfully at Alice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you the Golden Haired?” and he laid his hand
caressingly over the shining tresses just within his reach.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice was about to reply, when an exclamation from
those near the window, and the heavy tramp of horse’s
feet, arrested her attention, and drew her also to the
window, just as a beautiful grey, saddled but riderless,
came dashing over the gate, and tearing across the yard
until he stood panting at the door. <em>Rocket</em> had come
home for the first time since his master had lead him
away!</p>

<p class='c011'>Hearing of Hugh’s illness, the old colonel had ridden
over to inquire how he was, and fearing lest it might be
difficult to get Rocket away if once he stood in the
familiar yard, he had dismounted in the woods, and
fastening him to a tree, walked the remaining distance.
But Rocket was not thus to be cheated. Ever since
turning into the well-remembered lane he had seemed
like a new creature, pricking up his ears, and dancing and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>curvetting daintily along, as he had been wont to do on
public occasions when Hugh was his rider instead of the
fat colonel. In this state of feeling it was quite natural
that he should resent being tied to a tree, and as if divining
why it was done, he broke his halter the moment the
colonel was out of sight, and went galloping through the
woods like lightning, never for an instant slackening his
speed until he stood at Spring Bank door, calling, as well as
he could call, for Hugh, who heard and recognized that call.</p>

<p class='c011'>Throwing his arms wildly over his head, he raised
himself in bed, and exclaimed joyfully,</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s he! that’s Rocket! I knew he’d come. I’ve
only been waiting for him to start on that long journey.
Ho! Aunt Eunice! Pack my clothes. I’m going away
where I shan’t mortify <em>Ad</em> any more. Hurry up. Rocket
is growing impatient. Don’t you hear him pawing the
turf? I’m coming, my boy, I’m coming!” and he attempted
to leap upon the floor, but the doctor’s strong arm
held him down, while Alice, whose voice alone he heeded,
strove to quiet him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wouldn’t go away to-day,” she said soothingly.
“Some other time will do as well, and Rocket can wait.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will you stay with me?” Hugh asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I’ll stay,” was Alice’s reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right, all right. Tell Claib to put up Rocket, till
another day, and then we’ll go together, you and I,” and
Hugh sank back upon his pillow, just as the wheezy colonel
come in, greatly alarmed and surprised to find the
young man so ill.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It beats all,” he said, “how symptoms differ. That
buzzing he complained of wasn’t an atom like my wife’s—beats
all;” then turning to Alice he delivered a message
from Ellen who was better, and had expressed a wish
to see Miss Johnson, hoping she might be induced to return
with her father.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>But Alice would not leave Hugh, and she declined the
colonel’s invitation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s right. Stick to him,” the colonel said. “He’s
a noble fellow, odd as Dick’s hat band, but got the right
kind of spirit. Poor boy. It makes me feel to see him
some as I felt when my Hal lay ravin’ mad with the dumb
fever in his head. Poor Hal! He is up in the grave-yard
now. Good day to you all. I’ve got a pesky job on hand
getting that Rocket home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And the colonel was right, for Rocket stubbornly refused
to move, kicking and biting as he had done once
before when any one approached him. He had taken his
stand near by the block where Hugh had been accustomed
to mount him, and there he staid, evidently waiting for
his master, sometimes glancing toward the house and uttering
a low whinny.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I reckon I’ll have to leave him here for a spell,” the
colonel said at last when every stratagem had been resorted
to in vain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I ’specs mas’r will,” returned the delighted Claib,
who, had let one or two good opportunities pass for seizing
Rocket’s bridle. “I’ll get Mas’r Tiffton anodder nag,”
and with great alacrity the negro saddled a handsome bay,
on which the colonel was soon riding away from Spring
Bank, leaving Rocket standing patiently by the block, and
waiting for the master who might never come to him
again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m glad he’s roused up,” the doctor said of Hugh,
“though I don’t like the way his fever increases,” and
Alice knew by the expression of his face, that there was
but little hope, determining not to leave him during the
night.</p>

<p class='c011'>Aunt Eunice might sleep on the lounge, she said, but
the care, the responsibility should be hers. To this the doctor
willingly acceded, thinking that Hugh was safer with
her than any one else. Exchanging the white wrapper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>she had worn through the day for one more suitable, Alice,
after an hour’s rest in her own room, returned to Hugh,
who had missed her and who knew the moment she came
back to him, even though, he seemed to be half asleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>Softly the summer twilight faded and the stars came
out one by one, while the dark night closed over Spring
Bank, which held many anxious hearts. Never had a
cloud so black as this fallen upon the household. There
had been noisy, clamorous mourning when John Stanley
died, but amid that storm of grief there was one great
comfort still, Hugh was spared to them, but now he, too,
was leaving them they feared, and the sorrow which at
first had manifested itself in loud outcries had settled
down into a grief too deep, too heart-felt for noisy demonstrations.
In the kitchen where a light was burning
casting fitful, ghastly glances over the dusky forms congregated
there, old Chloe, as the patriarchess of the flock,
sat with folded arms, talking to those about her of her
master’s probable death, counting the few who had ever
survived that form of fever, and speculating as to who
would be their next owner. Would they be sold at
auction? Would they be parted one from the other, and
sent they knew not whither? The Lord only knew, old
Chloe said, as the hot tears rained over her black face,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mas’r Hugh won’t die,” and Muggins’ faith came to
the rescue, throwing a ray of hope into the darkness.
“Miss Alice axed God to spar him, and so did I; now he
will, won’t he, miss?” and she turned to Adah, who with
Sam, had just come up to Spring Bank, and hearing voices
in the kitchen had entered there first. “Say, Miss Adah,
won’t God cure Mas’r Hugh—case I axed him oncet?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You must pray more than once, child; pray many,
many times,” was Adah’s reply; whereupon Mug looked
aghast, for the idea of praying a second time had never
entered her brain.</p>

<p class='c011'>Still, if she must, why, she must, and she stole quietly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>from the kitchen. But it was now too dark to go down
in the woods by the running brook, and remembering
Alice had said that God was every where, she first cast
around her a timid glance, as if fearful she should see him,
and then kneeling in the grass, wet with the heavy night
dew, the little negro girl prayed again for Master Hugh,
starting as she prayed at the sound which met her ear
and which came from the spot where Rocket was standing
by the block, waiting for his master.</p>

<p class='c011'>Claib had offered him food and drink, but both had been
refused, and opening the stable door so that he could go in
whenever he chose, Claib had left him there alone.</p>

<p class='c011'>Muggins knew that it was Rocket, and stole up to him,
whispering as she laid her hand on his neck,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor Rocket, I’m sory too for Mas’r Hugh, but he
won’t die, ’case I’ve prayed for him. I has prayed twicet,
and I knows now he’ll live. If you could only pray—I
wonder if horses can!” and thinking she would ask the
new miss, Mug continued to stroke the horse, who suffered
her caress, and even rubbed his face against her arm, eating
the tuft of grass she plucked for him. Once Mug thought
of trying to lead him to the stall, but he looked so tall
and formidable, towering up above her, that she dared not,
and after a few more assurances that Mas’r Hugh would
live, she left him to himself, with the very sensible advice,
that if she’s he, she wouldn’t <em>ac</em> so, but would go to bed,
in the stable like a good boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Returning to the house Mug stole up stairs to the door
of the sick room, where Alice was now alone with Hugh.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was awake, and for an instant seemed to know
her, for he attempted to speak, but the rational words
died on his lips, and he only moaned, as if in distress.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is it?” Alice said, bending over him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you the Golden Haired?” he asked again as her
curls swept his face.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>“No, I’m not Golden Hair,” she answered, soothingly.
“I’m Alice, come to nurse you. You have heard of Alice
Johnson. ’Lina told you of her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Ad!</em>” he almost screamed. “Do you know Ad? I
am sorry for you. Who are you?” and as if determined
to solve the mystery he raised himself upon his elbow
and stretching out his hand, pushed her flowing curls back
from her sunny face, muttering as he did so, “‘There angels
do always behold his face.’ That’s in her Bible. I’m
reading it through. I began last winter, when Adah came.
Have you heard of Adah?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice had heard of Adah and suggested sending for
her, asking “if he would not like to have her come.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you go away?” he said, grasping her hand and
holding it fast. “No, you must not go. There’s something
in your face that makes me happy, something like
hers. When I say her or she, I mean Golden Hair. There’s
only one <em>her</em> to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who is Golden Hair?” Alice asked, and instantly the
great tears gathered in Hugh’s dark eyes as he replied.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t say who is she, but who was she. I’ve never
told a living being before. Golden Hair was a bright angel
who crossed my path one day, and then disappeared forever,
leaving behind the sweetest memory a mortal man ever
possessed. It’s weak for men to cry, but I have cried
many a night for her, when the clouds were crying, too,
and I heard against my window the rain which I knew
was falling upon her little grave.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He was growing excited, and thinking he had talked
too much, Alice was trying to quiet him, when the door
opened softly and Adah herself came in. Bowing politely
to Alice she advanced to Hugh’s bedside, and bending
over him spoke his name. He knew her, and turning to
Alice, said, “This is Adah; you will like each other; I
am sure.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And they did like each other at once, Alice recognizing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>readily a refinement of feeling and manner, which
showed that however unfortunate Adah might have been,
she was still the true-born lady, while Adah felt intuitively
that in Alice she had found a friend in whom she could trust.
For a few moments they talked together, and then
in the hall without there was a shuffling sound and Adah
knew that Sam was coming. With hobbling steps the
old man came in, scarcely noticing either of the ladies so
intent was he upon the figure lying so still and helpless,
before him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Massah Hugh, my poor, dear Massah Hugh,” he cried,
bending over his young master.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You may disturb him,” Adah said, putting from her
lap little Willie, who had come in with Sam, and at whom
Alice had looked with wonder, marvelling at the striking
resemblance between him and Hugh.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Could it be?” and Alice grew dizzy with that dreadful
thought. “<em>Could it be?</em> No, no, oh, no. Adah was
too pure, too good, while Hugh was too honorable,” and
Alice felt a pang at this injustice to both.</p>

<p class='c011'>Taking the child in her lap while Adah spoke with Sam
she smoothed his soft, brown hair, and scanned his infantile
features closely, tracing now another look than Hugh’s,
a look which made her start as if smitten suddenly. The
eyes, the brow, the hair were Hugh’s, but for the rest;
the dedicate mouth, with its dimpled corners, the curve of
the lip, the nose, the whole lower part of the face was like,
oh, so like, sweet <em>Anna Richards</em>, and <em>she</em> was like <em>her
brother</em>. Alice had heard from ’Lina that Adah professed
to have had a husband who deserted her and as she held
Willie in her lap, there were all sorts of fancies in her
bewildered brain nor was it until a loud outcry from Sam,
fell on her ear that she roused herself from the castle she
was building as to what might be if Willie were indeed
of the Richard’s line. Sam had turned away from Hugh,
and with his usual politeness was about making his obeisance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>to Alice, when the words, “Your servant, Miss,” were
changed into a howl of joy, and falling upon his knees, he
clutched at Alice’s dress, exclaiming,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now de Lord be praised, I’se found her again. I’se
found Miss Ellis, an’ I feels like singin’ ‘Glory Hallelujah.’
Does ye know me, lady? Does you ’member shaky ole
darkey, way down in Virginny? You teach him de way,
an’ he’s tried to walk dar ever sence. Say, does you know
ole Sam?” and the dim eyes looked eagerly into Alice’s
face.</p>

<p class='c011'>She did remember him, and for a moment seemed speechless
with surprise, then, stooping beside him, she took his
shrivelled hand and pressed it between her own, asking
how he came there, and if Hugh had always been his
master.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You ’splain, Miss Adah. You speaks de dictionary
better than Sam,” the old man said, and thus appealed to,
Adah told what she knew of Sam’s coming into Hugh’s
possession.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He buy me just for kindness, nothing else, for Sam
aint wo’th a dime, but Massa Hugh so good. I prays for
him every night, and I asks God to bring you and him together.
Oh, I’se happy chile to-night. I prays wid a big
heart, ’case I sees Miss Ellis again,” and in his great joy
Sam kissed the hem of Alice’s dress, crouching at her feet
and regarding her with a look almost idolatrous.</p>

<p class='c011'>At sight of his nurse Willie had slid from Alice’s lap
and with his arm around Sam’s neck, was lisping the only
words he as yet could speak, “Up, up, Tam, Willie up,”
meaning that he must be taken. Struggling to his feet
Sam took Willie on his shoulder, then with another blessing
on Miss Ellis and a pitying glance at Hugh, he left
the room, Willie looking down from his elevated position
triumphant as a young lord, and crowing in childish glee
as he buried his hands in Uncle Sam’s white wool.</p>

<p class='c011'>In every move which Willie made there was a decidedly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>Richards’ air, a manner such as would have been expected
from John Richards’ son playing in the halls of
Terrace Hill.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is Willie like his father?” Alice asked as the door
closed after Sam.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” and a shadow flitted over Adah’s face.</p>

<p class='c011'>She did not like to talk of Willie’s father and was glad
when Hugh at last claimed their attention. They watched
together that night, tending Hugh so carefully that
when the morning broke and the physician came, he pronounced
the symptoms so much better that there was hope,
he said, if the faithful nursing were continued. Still Hugh
remained delirious, lying often in a kind of stupor from
which nothing had power to arouse him unless it were
Alice’s voice, whispering in his ear the name of “Golden
Hair,” or the cry of Rocket, who for an entire week waited
patiently by the block, his face turned towards the door
whence he expected his master to appear. During the
day he would neither eat nor drink, but Claib always found
the food and drink gone, which was left in the stall at
night, showing that Rocket must have passed the hours of
darkness in his old, accustomed place. With the dawn of
day, however, he returned to his post by the block, and
more than one eye filled with tears at sight of the noble
brute waiting so patiently and calling so pitifully for one
who never came. But Rocket grew tired at last, and they
missed him one morning at Spring Bank, while Col. Tiffton
on that same morning was surprised and delighted to
find him standing demurely by the gate and offering no
resistance when they led him to the stable which he never
tried to leave again. He seemed to have given Hugh
up and a part of the affection felt for his young master
was transferred to the colonel, who petted and caressed
the beautiful animal, sighing the while as he thought how
improbable it was that Hugh ever could redeem him, and
how if he did not, the time was coming soon when Rocket
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>must again change masters, and when <em>Harney’s</em> long
cherished wish to possess him would undoubtedly be gratified.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXI.<br> <span class='large'>ALICE AND ADAH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>At Alice’s request, Adah and Sam staid altogether at
Spring Bank, but Alice was the ruling power—Alice,
the one whom Chloe and Claib consulted; Alice to whom
Aunt Eunice looked for counsel, Alice, who remembered all
the doctor’s directions, taking the entire charge of Hugh’s
medicines herself—and Alice, who wrote to Mrs. Worthington,
apprising her of Hugh’s illness. They hoped he
was not dangerous, she said, but he was very sick, and
Mrs. Worthington would do well to come at once. She
did not mention ’Lina, but the idea never crossed her
mind that a sister <em>could</em> stay away from choice when a
brother was so ill; and it was with unfeigned surprise
that she one morning saw Mrs. Worthington and Lulu
alighting at the gate, but no ’Lina with them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She was so happy at Saratoga,” Mrs. Worthington
said, when a little over the first flurry of her arrival.
“So happy, too, with Mrs. Richards that she could not
tear herself away, unless her mother should find Hugh
positively dangerous, in which case she should, of course,
come at once.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was the mother’s charitable explanation, made
with a bitter sigh as she recalled ’Lina’s heartless anger
when the letter was received, as if Hugh were to blame, as
indeed, ’Lina seemed to think he was.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What business had he to come home so quick? If he’d
staid in New Orleans, he might not have had the fever.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>Any way, she wasn’t going home. Alice had said he was
not dangerous yet, so if her mother went, that was
enough;” and utterly forgetful of the many weary hours
and days when Hugh had watched by her, the heartless
girl had stifled every feeling of self reproach, and hurried
her mother off, entrusting to her care a note for Alice,
who, she felt, would wonder at her singular conduct.</p>

<p class='c011'>Giving the note to Alice, Mrs. Worthington hastened to
her child, with whom Adah and Sam were sitting. He
had just awakened from a quiet sleep, and knew his mother
at once. Winding his arms around her, he kissed her
forehead and lips, and then his eyes wandered past her
towards the door through which she had entered, as if
in quest of some one else. His mother did not observe
the glance, or know for whom he was looking so wistfully
until the white lips whispered, “’Lina, mother, where is
she?”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was strange for him to call her ’Lina. Indeed, the
mother could remember no other time when he had done
so, but he called her ’Lina now, speaking it tenderly, as if
her presence would be very welcome to him. There was a
hesitancy on the part of the mother, and then she said,
“’Lina staid in Saratoga. She is very happy there. She
will come if you grow worse. She sent her love.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Poor Mrs. Worthington! She mentally asked forgiveness
for this fabrication. ’Lina had sent no love, and the
mother only said so because she must say something.
Wistfully, eagerly, Hugh’s eyes sought hers for a moment,
and then filled with tears which dropped upon the pillow.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did you want ’Lina to come?” Mrs. Worthington
asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” and Hugh’s lip quivered like a grieved child.
“I’m going to die, and I wanted to tell her how sorry I
am for the harsh things I’ve said to her. I’ve been crazy
some, I guess, for nothing was clear in my mind—nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>but the words ‘Forgive as ye would be forgiven.’ They
were the last I ever read in that little Bible you never
saw. It’s in my trunk, and when I’m gone you’ll give it
to Miss Johnson. I think she’s here; and you’ll tell
’Lina I was sorry, and if—if—if she’s ever sorry, tell
her I forgive her, and wanted her to come so much. I
thought, maybe, she’d kiss me; she never has since she was
a little child. If she comes before you put me out of
sight, ask her to kiss me in the coffin, because I was her
brother. I shall be sure to know it. Will you, mother?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Worthington could only sob as she pressed the
hands she held between her own and tried to quiet him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meantime Alice, in her own room, was reading ’Lina’s
note, containing a most glowing description of the delightful
time she was having at Saratoga, and how hard it would
be to leave.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know <em>dear Hugh</em> is in good hands,” she wrote, “and
it is so pleasant here that I really do want to stay a little
longer. What a delightful lady that Mrs. Richards is—not
one bit stiff as I can see. I don’t know what people
mean, to call her proud. She has promised, if mamma
will leave me here, to be my chaperon, and it’s possible we
may visit New York together, so as to be there when the
Prince arrives. Won’t that be grand? She talks so
much of you that sometimes I’m really jealous. Perhaps
I may go to Terrace Hill before I return, but I rather
hope not, it makes me fidgetty to think of meeting the
Misses Richards, though, of course, I know I shall like them,
particularly Anna.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Not a word was there in this letter of the doctor, but
Alice understood it all the same. <em>He</em> was the attraction
which kept the selfish girl from her brother’s side. “May
she be happy with him,” was Alice’s mental comment,
shuddering as she recalled the time when she was pleased
with the handsome doctor, and silently thanking God who
had saved her from much sorrow.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>Just then Adah came in, and sitting down by the window
seemed to be looking at something far away, something,
which brought to her face the sad hopeless expression,
which Alice had often observed before. Drawing near
to her Alice said softly, “Of what are you thinking,
Adah?”</p>

<p class='c011'>There were no reserves now between the two girls, and
laying her head in Alice’s lap, Adah sobbed, “I’m thinking
of Willie’s father. Will he never come back? Can
it be he meant to deceive me, Miss Johnson?” and Adah
lifted up her head, disclosing a face which Alice scarcely
recognized, for the strange expression there. “Miss Johnson,
if I knew that George deliberately planned my ruin
under the guise of a mock marriage, and then when it
suited him deserted me as a toy of which he was tired, <em>I
should hate him!</em>”</p>

<p class='c011'>She hissed the words between her shut teeth, and Alice
involuntarily shuddered at the hard, relentless look, which
only a deceived, deserted woman can wear. She did not
dream that Adah, who had seemed so gentle, so good, could
put on such a look, and she gazed at her in astonishment,
as in clear, determined tones she repeated the words,
“Yes, <em>I should hate him!</em></p>

<p class='c011'>“I know it’s wrong,” she continued, “and I’ve asked
God many a time to take the feeling away, but it’s in me
yet, and sometimes, when I get to thinking of the time
before he came, when I was a happy, innocent school girl,
without a care for anything, my heart turns into stone,
and the prayer I would say will not come. Miss Johnson,
you don’t know what it is to love with your whole soul
one who, to all appearance, was worthy of your love, and
who, the world would say, was above you in position—to
trust him implicitly, to worship the very earth he trod,
to feel ’twas Heaven where he was, to have no shadow of
suspicion, to believe yourself his lawful wife, and then
some dreadful morning wake up and find him gone, you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>know not where—to wait and watch through weary
weeks and months of agonizing pain, and then to hear at
last, in his own handwriting, that you were not a wife
that the whole was a mockery, a marriage of convenience,
which circumstances rendered it necessary for him to
break, that his proud family would not receive you, that
though he loved you still, his bride must be rich to please
his aristocratic mother, and then to end with the hope
thrown out that sometime he might come back and make
you truly his. But for that I should have died, and, as it
was, I felt my heart-strings snapping, one by one, felt the
blood freezing in my veins, felt that I was going mad. I
frighten you, Miss Johnson,” she said, as she saw how
Alice shrunk away from the dark eyes in which there
was a fierce, resentful gleam, unlike sweet Adah Hastings.
“I used to frighten myself when I saw in my eyes the demon
which whispered suicide.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Adah, Mrs. Hastings,” and Alice involuntarily
wound her arm around the young girl-woman as if to
shield her from sin. “You could not have dreamed of
that!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I did,” and Adah spoke sadly now. “I forgot God
awhile, and He left me to myself, but followed me still,
going with me all through those crowded streets,
close at my side, though I did not know it, and holding
me back at the last moment, when the tempter was about
to triumph, and the river rolling at my feet looked so invitingly
to poor, half-crazed me, He put other thoughts
in my head, and where I went to throw my life away, I
knelt down and prayed. It was kind in God to save me,
and I’ve tried to love Him better since, to thank Him for
His great goodness in leading me to Hugh, as He surely
did; but there’s something savage in my nature, which
has not been all subdued, and sometimes I’m rebellious,
just as you see me now, and my heart, which at first was
full of love for George, goes out against him for his base
treachery.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>“And yet you love him still?” Alice said, inquiringly
as she smoothed the beautiful brown hair.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I suppose I do. A kind word from him would bring
me back, but will it ever be spoken? Shall we ever meet
again?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She was silent a moment, and then Alice said, “I do
not seek your confidence unless you are willing to give it.
As you have told me your story in part, will you tell me
the whole?”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no vindictiveness now in Adah’s face, and
the soft brown eyes drooped mournfully beneath the heavy
lashes as she told the story of her wrongs. Told of
a young girl at Madam Dupont’s school, of the elegant
stranger present at one examination, and who watched
her with unfeigned interest as she worked out upon the
board a most difficult problem in Euclid, standing so near
to her that once when she accidentally dropped her crayon
he picked it up and offered it to her with a few whispered
words of commendation for her skill in mathematics. Of
a chance meeting in the street. Of walks and rides, and
blissful interviews at her own cozy little room in the
boarding-house, where she had lived for years. Of marriage
proposed at last, and sanctioned by her guardian.
Of the necessity urged upon her why it should be kept a
secret until the proud relatives were reconciled. Of going
one night with her lover, her guardian and another witness,
far out into the suburbs of the city to the house of
a justice, who made her George’s wife. Of her guardian’s
sudden departure, she knew not whither. Of a removal
to another boarding-house more obscure, and in a part of
the city where she never met again with any whom she
had known before. Of months of perfect happiness.
Of the hope growing within her that she was gradually,
leading George to God. Of letters from home which made
him blue, and which she never saw. Of his leaving her at
last without a word or sign that he was going or had grown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>weary of her. Of the terrible suspense, the cruel letter,
the attempt to take her life, of Willie’s birth, of her being
turned from the house as a disreputable character, and
coming at last to Spring Bank in quest of Hugh, and of
the gradual dying out, as she sometimes feared, of her love
for George Hastings.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And Hugh?” Alice said, when Adah paused. “Why
did you come to him? Had you known him before?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hugh was that other witness. I never saw him till
that night, neither, I think, did George. My guardian
planned the whole.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hugh Worthington is not the man I took him for,”
and Alice spoke bitterly, a look of horror on her face which
Adah quickly detected.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You mistake him,” she cried eagerly. “He is all you
imagine him to be, the noblest, truest man, and the best
friend I ever had. My guardian possessed a most singular
power over all young men, and Hugh was fresh from the
country. I don’t know where or how they met, but at a
hotel, I think. He did not know it was a farce. He went
in perfect good faith, although he says since that it did
once occur to him that something might be wrong.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And your guardian,” interrupted Alice, “is it not
strange that he should have acted so cruel a part, particularly
if, as you sometimes fancied, he was your father?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, that’s the strangest part of all. I cannot understand
it, or where he is, though I sometimes imagined he
must be dead, or in prison,” and Adah thought of what
Sam had said concerning Sullivan, the negro-stealer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do you mean; why should he be in prison?”
Alice asked in some surprise, and Adah replied by telling
her what Sam had said, and the reason she had for thinking
Sullivan and her guardian, Redfield, one and the
same.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just then Willie’s voice was heard in the hall, and hastening
to the door Alice admitted him into the room.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>Taking him in her lap she kissed his rosy cheek, and pushing
back his soft curls said to Adah, “Do you know I
think he looks like <em>Hugh</em>?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” and Adah spoke sadly. “I know he does, and
I am sorry for Hugh’s sake, as it must annoy him. Neither
can I account for it, for I am certainly nothing to
Hugh. But there’s another look in Willie’s face, his father’s.
Oh, Miss Johnson, George was handsome, and ’twas
his face which first attracted me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can you describe him, or will it be too painful?” Alice
asked, and forcing back her tears, Adah told how
George Hastings looked, while Alice’s hands worked nervously
together, and her heart beat almost audibly, for,
save the absence of moustache and whiskers, which might
have been grown since, Adah was describing <em>Dr. Richards</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you’ve never seen him since, nor heard from him,
nor guessed where his mother lived?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never, and when only the wrong is remembered, I
think I never care to see or hear from him again; but
when the love I bore him comes surging back, as it sometimes
does, I’d crawl to the end of the world for one more
tender look from him. I’d lay his boy at his feet and die
there myself so willingly. I used to form all sorts of castles
about his coming after me, but they are all blown
down, and I’ve learned to look the future in the face, to
know that I must meet it alone. I wish there was something
I could do to relieve Hugh of the expense I am to
him. I did not know till after I was sick last spring how
very poor he was, and how many self denials he had to
make for his family. I heard his mother talking with
Aunt Eunice when they thought I was asleep, and it
almost broke my heart. He goes without decent clothes,
without a fire in his room on wintry nights, goes without
every thing, and then <em>’Lina</em> calls him mean and stingy.
The noble, self-denying Hugh! I would almost die for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>him; and I ask God every day to bring him some good
fortune at last.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I never knew that Mr. Worthington was so straightened,”
said Alice. “Was Rocket sold to Col. Tiffton for
debt?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, for ’Lina’s debts, contracted at Harney’s and for
my sick bills, too. I’ve cried the hardest over that, for I
know how Hugh loved that horse, but the worst of it is
that Col. Tiffton has in some way become indebted to
Harney for an immense sum of money. I don’t understand
it, but the colonel signed a note for ten thousand
dollars with somebody and for somebody, both of which
somebodys have failed, and the colonel has to pay. It
will take his home, they say, and his personal property,
including Rocket, whom Harney is determined to secure.
I’ve heard of his boasting that Hugh should yet be compelled
to see him galloping down the pike upon his idol.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He never shall!” and Alice spoke under her breath,
asking further questions concerning the sale of Colonel
Tiffton’s house, and how much Mosside was worth.</p>

<p class='c011'>Adah could not tell. She only knew that Rocket was
pawned for five hundred dollars. “Once I insanely hoped
that I might help redeem him—that God would find a
work for me to do—and my heart was so happy for a
moment.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What did you think of doing?” Alice asked, glancing
at the delicate young girl, who looked so unaccustomed
to toil of any kind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I thought to be a governess or waiting-maid,” and
Adah’s lip began to quiver as she told how, before coming
to Spring Bank, she had advertised for such a situation;
how she had waited and watched for an answer, and how
at last it came, or at least the words seemed addressed <em>to
her</em>, and she had thought to answer it, but had been discouraged
by ’Lina.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you remember the address?” and Alice waited curiously
for the answer.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>“Yes, ‘A. E. R., <span class='sc'>Snowdon</span>.’ You came from Snowdon,
Miss Johnson, and I’ve wanted so much to ask if you
knew ‘A. E. R.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice was confounded. Surely the leadings of Providence
were too plainly evident to be unnoticed. There
was a reason why Adah Hastings must go to Anna Richards,
and Alice hastened to explain who the Richards family
were.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I can’t go there. They are too proud. They
would hate me for Willie, and ask me for his father,” Adah
cried, the tears breaking through the fingers she pressed
before her eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very gently Alice talked to her of Anna, so lovely in
disposition, so beautiful in her mature womanhood.
Adah would be happy with her, she said, and Anna would
be a second mother to her child. She did not hint of her
suspicions that at Terrace Hill Adah would find <em>George</em>
for fear she might be mistaken, but she talked of Snowdon
and Anna Richards, whom Adah was sure to like.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m so glad for your sake that it has come round at
last,” she said. “Will you write to her to-day, or shall I
for you? Perhaps I had better.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, no, oh, no—” and Adah’s voice trembled, for she
shrank nervously from the thought of meeting the Richards
family.</p>

<p class='c011'>If ’Lina liked the old lady, she certainly could not, and
the very thought of these elder sisters, in all their primness,
dismayed and disheartened her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There’s a young man, is there not—a Dr. Richards?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; but he is not often at home. He need be no bugbear.
He is practicing in New York, when practicing at
all. At present he is at Saratoga.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Adah looked up quickly, guessing, in a moment, what
was keeping ’Lina there, and feeling more averse than
ever to Terrace Hill.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>Gradually, however, as Alice continued to talk of Anna,
her feelings changed and she said at last, “I will go to
Miss Richards, but not till Hugh is better, not till he
knows and approves. Do you think it will be long before
be regains his reason!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice could not tell. She hoped for the best, and
thought with Adah that she ought to stay until he could
be consulted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you correspond with Miss Richards?” Adah suddenly
asked, after a long reverie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, she dreads writing letters above all things else,
while I am a wretchedly negligent correspondent. I will
send a note of introduction by you, though.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Please don’t,” and Adah spoke pleadingly, “I should
have to give it if you did, and I’d rather go by myself.
I know it would be better to have your influence, but it
is a fancy of mine not to say that I ever knew you or any
one at Spring Bank. I imagine this Dr. likes ’Lina, and
they might question me of her. I could not say much
that was good, and I should not like to say bad things
of Hugh’s sister. Then, too, Miss Richards never need
know of my past life unless I choose to let her, as I
should have to do in telling her how I came at Spring
Bank.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice could understand Adah’s motives in part, and
feeling sure that whatever she might say would be the
truth, she did not press the matter, but suffered her to
proceed in her own way. Now it was settled that Adah
should go, she felt a restless, impatient desire to be gone,
questioning the doctor closely with regard to Hugh, who
it seemed to her, would never waken from the state of
unconsciousness into which he had fallen, and from which
he only rallied for an instant, just long enough to recognize
his mother, but never Alice or herself, both of whom
watched over him day and night, waiting anxiously for
the first symptom which should herald his return to reason.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXII.<br> <span class='large'>WAKING TO CONSCIOUSNESS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The warm still days of September were gone and a wild
October storm was dying out in a gentle shower, when
Hugh awoke from the sleep which had so long hung over
him, and listened, with a vague kind of delicious happiness,
to the lulling music of the rain falling so softly upon
the window sill, and sifting through the long boughs of
the trees, visible from where he lay. Gazing about him
in a maze of perplexity, he wondered what had happened,
or where he could be.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must have been sick,” he whispered, and pressing his
hand to his head, he tried to recall and form into some definite
shape the events which had seemed, and which seemed
to him still, like so many phantoms of the brain.</p>

<p class='c011'>Was it a dream—his mother’s tears, upon his face, his
mother’s sobs beside him? Was it a dream that <em>Adah</em>
had bent over him with words of tenderness, praying for
him that he might not die, as he was sure he had heard
her? And,—oh how Hugh started as he thought this;—Was
it all a dream that the Golden Haired had been with
him constantly?</p>

<p class='c011'>No, that was not a dream, and Hugh lay panting on
his pillow, as gleam after gleam flashed across his mind,
bringing remembrance of the many times when another
voice than Adah’s had asked that he might live, had pleaded
as only Golden Hair could plead with God for him. She
did not hate him, else she had not prayed, and words of
thanksgiving were going up to Golden Hair’s God, when
a footstep in the hall announced the approach of some one.
Alice perhaps, and Hugh lay very still, with half shut
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>eyes, until Muggins, instead of Alice, appeared. She had
been deputed to watch by her master while the family
were at dinner, pleased with the confidence reposed in her,
determined strictly to obey Alice’s injunction to be very
quiet, and not wake him if he were sleeping.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was asleep, she said, as, standing on tiptoe, she
scanned his face, in her own dialect, Muggins talked to
herself about him as he lay there so still, not a muscle
moving, save those about the corners of his mouth, where
a smile was struggling for life, as Hugh listened to Mug’s
remarks.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nice Mas’r Hugh—most as white as Miss Alice. De
sweat has washed de dirt all off. Pretty Mas’r Hugh!”
and Mug’s little black hand was laid caressingly on the
face she admired so much. “I mean to ask God about
him, just like I see Miss Alice do,” she continued, and
stealing to the opposite side of the room, Muggins kneeled
down, and with her face turned towards Hugh, she said,
first, the prayer taught by Alice after an immense amount
of labor and patience, after which she continued, “If
God is hearin’ me, will he please do all dat Miss Alice ax
him ’bout curin’ Mas’r Hugh, only not take him to heaven
as she say, and scuse Mug, who is nothin’ but poor
little lazy nigger, all-us round under foot.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was too much for Hugh. The sight of that ignorant
negro child, kneeling by the window, with her
hands clasped supplicatingly together, as she prayed for
him in imitation of the Golden Haired, unmanned him
entirely, and hiding his head beneath the sheets, he
sobbed aloud. With a nervous start, Mug arose from
her knees, and coming towards him, stood for an instant
gazing in mute terror at the trembling of the bed-clothes
which hid her master from sight.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll bet he’s in a fit. I mean to screech for Miss
Alice,” and Muggins was about darting away, when
Hugh’s long arm caught and held her fast. “Oh, de gracious,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>Mas’r Hugh,” she cried, “you skeers me so.
Does you know me, Mas’r Hugh?” and somewhat relieved
by the expression of his face, she took a step towards
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I know you, and I want to talk a little. Where
am I, Mug? What room, I mean?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, Miss Alice’s in course. She ’sisted, and ’sisted
till ’em brung you in here, ’case she say it cool and nice.
Oh, Miss Alice so fine.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In Miss Johnson’s room,” and Hugh looked perfectly
bewildered, while Mug explained how Miss Alice “had
prayed for Mas’r Hugh, and cried for Mas’r Hugh, and
she didn’t know but she had actually kissed Mas’r Hugh;
any way, she got mighty clus to him sometimes.
“Where is she now?” Hugh asked, and Mug replied,
“Eatin her dinner, she watched las’ night and bimeby
she’s gwine to lie down. I hearn her say so, an’ old Miss
comin’ to set long of you!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hugh felt a pang of disappointment that he should not
probably see Alice that afternoon. But she needed sleep,
he knew, and he was mentally chiding himself for his
selfishness, when his mother stepped into the room.
She looked so pale and thin that Hugh involuntarily
groaned as he thought how she had grown weary and
worn for him who had sometimes accused her of indifference.
The groan caught Mrs. Worthington’s ear, and
bending over him she said,</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is it, Hugh?” “Are you worse? Do you want
anything?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I’m better—the cobwebs are gone. I am myself
again—dear, darling mother,” and Hugh stretched his
hands towards her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, my boy, I am so glad, so glad! God is good to
give you back, when I’ve never served Him all my life,
but I’m trying to now. Oh, Hugh, my heart is so full,”
and Mrs. Worthington’s tears dropped fast, as like a weary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>child, which wanted to be soothed, she laid her head
upon his bosom, crying quietly.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Hugh, stronger now than she, held the poor, tired
head there, and kissed the white forehead, where there
were more wrinkles than when he last observed it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Folding his weak arms about her, mother and son wept
together in that moment of perfect understanding and
union with each other. Hugh was the first to rally. It
seemed so pleasant to lean on him, to know that he cared
so much for her, that Mrs. Worthington would gladly have
rested on his bosom longer, but Hugh who noticed that
she held an open letter in her hand brought her back to
something of the old, sad life, by asking.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If the letter were from ’Lina?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, and I can’t make it all out you know she writes
so blind.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It never troubles me, and I feel perfectly able to read
it,” Hugh said, and taking the letter from her unresisting
hand, he asked that another pillow should be placed
beneath his head, while he read it aloud.</p>

<p class='c011'>The pillow was arranged, and then Mrs. Worthington
sat down upon the bed to hear the letter, which read as
follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Fifth Avenue Hotel, New York</span>,</div>
      <div class='line in12'>“October, 1860:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Mother</span>,—</p>

<p class='c012'>“What a little eternity it is since I heard from you, and
how am I to know that you are not all dead and buried.
Were it not that no news is good news, I should sometimes
fancy that Hugh was worse, and feel terribly for not
having gone home when you did. But of course if he
were worse, you would write, and so I settle down upon
that, and quiet my troublesome conscience.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, then, to business, I want Hugh to send me some
money, or all is lost. Let me explain.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>“Here I am at Fifth Avenue Hotel, as good as any lady,
if my purse is almost empty. Plague on it, why didn’t
that Mrs. Johnson send me two thousand instead of one?
It would not hurt her, and then I should get through
nicely.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You see that thousand is almost gone and as board is
two and a half dollars per day, I can’t stay long and shop
in Broadway with old Mrs. Richards as I am expected to
do in my capacity of heiress. There never was so lucky
a hit as that, or anything that took so well, just think—I,
Adeline Worthington, <em>nee</em> Adeline Murdoch, who used to
help wash her own clothes in Elmwood, and who once
talked of learning a vulgar trade, and did sew a week for
old Aunt Jerusha Tubbs, here am I, metamorphosed into
a Kentucky heiress, who can say and do anything she
pleases on the strength of being an heiress, and hailing
from a State where folks own niggers. I tell you, <em>Spring
Bank, Kentucky</em>—has done wonders for me in the way
of getting me noticed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You see I am a pure Southern woman here; nobody
but Mrs. Richards knows that I was born, mercy knows
where. But for you, she never need have known it either,
but you must tell that we had not always lived in Kentucky.
Honestly, I was glad when you left.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But to do Mrs. Richards justice, she never alludes to
my birth, and you ought to hear her introduce me to some
of her friends, ‘Mrs. So and So, Miss Worthington from
Spring Bank, Kentucky,’ then in an aside, which I am not
supposed to hear, she adds, ‘A great heiress of a very respectable
family. You may have heard of them.’ Somehow,
this always makes me uncomfortable, as it brings up
certain cogitations touching that scamp you were silly
enough to marry, thereby giving me to the world, which
my delectable brother no doubt thinks would have been
better off without me. But to proceed—</p>

<p class='c012'>“We left Saratoga a week ago—old lady Richards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>wanted to go to Terrace Hill awhile and show me to Anna
who it seems is a kind of family oracle. If she approve
<em>Johnny’s</em> choice, it is all right.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who is <em>Johnny</em>?” Hugh asked, his face a purplish
hue and contrasting strangely with the ashen one resting
on his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Worthington explained to him what she knew of
Dr. Richards, and Hugh went on:</p>

<p class='c012'>“After counting the little gold eagles in my purse, I said
perhaps I’d go for a few days, though I dreaded it terribly,
for the doctor had not yet bound himself fast, and I
did not know what the result of those three old maid sisters,
sitting on me, would be. Old lady was quite happy
in prospect of going home, when one day a letter come
from Anna. I happened to have a headache, and was lying
on madam’s bed, when the dinner bell rang. Of course
I insisted that madam should go down without me, and
of course she went. It was tedious lying there alone,
and to pass away the time I just peeped into the letter,
feeling amply rewarded by the insight I obtained into the
family secrets.</p>

<p class='c012'>“They are poorer than I supposed, but that does not
matter, position is what I want. Anna has an income of
her own, and, generous soul that she is, gives it out to her
mother. You see there had been some talk of her coming
to Saratoga, and in referring to it, said, ‘Much as I might
enjoy it, I cannot afford to come, I can pay your bills for
some time longer, if you really think the water a benefit,
but my presence would just double the expense. Then,
if brother does marry, I wish to surprise him with a handsome
set of pearls for his bride, and I am economizing to
do so.’ (Note by ’Lina)—Isn’t she a clever old soul?
Don’t she deserve a better sister-in-law than I shall make
her, and won’t I find the way to her purse often?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Hugh groaned aloud, and the letter dropped from his
hand.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>“Mother,” he gasped, “it must not be. ’Lina shall not
thrust herself upon them. This Anna shall not be so cruelly
deceived. I don’t care a picayune for the doctor or
the old lady. They are much like ’Lina, I reckon, but
this Anna awakens my sympathy. I mean to warn her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hugh,” and in the mother’s voice there was a tone
which startled him, “Hugh, let her alone. Let Dr.
Richards marry her if he will. You and I shall be——”</p>

<p class='c012'>The trembling voice faltered, for it could not say “happier
without her,” but Hugh understood it, and smoothing
the soft, thin hair of the head nestling close to him, he replied,</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes we should be happier with ’Lina gone, but there’s
a right and there’s a wrong, which is it best to choose?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t know. Oh, I don’t know. The right, I suppose.
We’ll decide by and by. Read on.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And Hugh did read on, feeling as if he, too were guilty,
thus to know what Anna Richards had intended only for
her mother’s eye.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘From some words you have dropped, I fancy that
Miss Worthington does not suit you in all respects, and
you wish me to see her. Dear mother, John marries for
himself, not for us, and though I could wish my new sister
to be every way congenial, I shall try to like her, even
if there are certain little coarse points about her. These
may result from education rather than bad blood, and if
so, they can easily be rubbed off. If she is bright and
observing she will soon learn that slang phrases together
with loud talking and laughing, are not lady-like or marks
of cultivation. But we must be very cautious not to let
her know what we are doing. Extreme kindness and affection
must mark every action, and in the end we shall
succeed. If John is satisfied and happy, that is all I ask.
Asenath and Eudora think you had better persuade her
to come home with you for a few days before going to
New York and I concur in their wishes. The house will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>seem dull to her, no doubt, after Saratoga gayeties but
we will make it as pleasant as possible.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘When will you come? Asenath has sent the curtains
in the north chamber to the laundress, but will go
no farther until we hear for certain that Miss Worthington
is to be our guest. Write immediately.</p>

    <div class='group'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“There then, this is what I read, lying on madam’s
bed, and it decided my future course. Do you suppose
I’m going to Terrace Hill to be watched by that trio of
old maids? No, ma’am, not by a ——, I was going to
say ‘jug full,’ but remembered slang phrases just in time.
Anna would be delighted with that improvement.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am resolved now to win Dr. Richards at all hazards.
Only let me keep up the appearance of wealth,
and the thing is easily accomplished; but I can’t go to
Terrace Hill yet, cannot meet this Anna, for, I dread her
decision more than all the rest, inasmuch as I know it
would have more weight with the doctor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But to come back to madam. I was fast asleep
when she returned. Had not read Anna’s letter, nor anything!
You should have seen her face when I told her I
had changed my mind, that I could not go to Terrace Hill,
that <em>mamma</em> (that’s you!) did not think it would be proper,
inasmuch as I had no claim upon them. You see, I made
her believe I had written to you on the subject, receiving
a reply that you disapproved of my going, and brother
Hugh, too, I quote him a heap, making madam laugh till
she cries with repeating his odd speeches, she does so
want to see that eccentric Hugh, she says.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Another groan from Mrs. Worthington—something
sounding like an oath from Hugh, and he went on:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I said, brother was afraid it was improper under the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>circumstances for me to go, afraid lest people should talk;
that I preferred going at once to New York. So it was
finally decided, to the doctor’s relief, I fancied, that we
come here, and here we are—hotel just like a beehive,
and my room is in the fifth story.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is very expensive staying here at two dollars and a
half per day, and I want so much to see England’s future
king. Then, too, I am determined to bring the doctor to
terms, and so rid you and Hugh of myself, but to do
this, I must have more money, and you must manage
some way to get it. Beg, borrow, pawn, or <em>steal</em>, any
thing to get it at once.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Your distracted</div>
      <div class='line in28'>“Lina.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“P. S. One day later. Rejoice, oh, rejoice! and give
ear. The doctor has actually asked the question, and I
blushingly referred him to mamma, but he seemed to
think this unnecessary, took alarm at once, and pressed
the matter until I said yes. Aren’t you glad? But one
thing is sure—Hugh must sell a nigger to get me a
handsome outfit. There’s Mug, always under foot, doing
no one any good. She’ll bring six hundred any day,
she’s so bright and healthy. Nobody will think of abusing
her either, she’s so cunning, and thus Hugh can
swallow his Abolition principles for once, and bestir himself
to find a buyer for Muggins. Lulu he must give
me out and out for a waiting-maid. There’s no other alternative.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So absorbed were Hugh and his mother, as not to hear
the low howl of fear echoing through the hall, as Mug
fled in terror from the dreaded new owner to whom Master
Hugh was to sell her. Neither did they hear the cat-like tread
with which Lulu glided past the door, taking
the same direction Mug had gone, namely, to Alice Johnson’s
room.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>Lulu had been sitting by the open window at the end
of the hall, and had heard every word of this letter, while
Mug, sent by Chloe on some errand to Mrs. Worthington,
had reached the threshold in time to hear all that was
said about selling her. Instinctively both turned for protection
to Alice, but Mug was the first to reach her.
Throwing herself upon her knees and hiding her face in
Alice’s dress she sobbed frantically,</p>

<p class='c011'>“You buys me, Miss Alice. You give Mas’r Hugh six
hundred dollars for me, so’t he can get Miss ’Lina’s weddin’
finery. I’ll be good, I will. I’ll learn de Lord’s prar,
ebery word on’t; will you, Miss Alice, say?”</p>

<p class='c011'>In amazement Alice tried to wrest her muslin dress from
the child’s grasp, asking what she meant.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know, I’ll tell,” and Lulu scarcely less excited, but
more capable of restraining herself, advanced into the room,
and ere the bewildered Alice could well understand what
it all meant, or make more than a feeble attempt to stop
her, she had repeated rapidly the entire contents of ’Lina’s
letter, omitting nothing of any consequence, but, as was
quite natural, dwelling longest upon the engagement, as
that was the point which particularly concerned herself
and Muggins.</p>

<p class='c011'>Too much amazed at first to speak, Alice sat motionless,
then rallying her scattered senses, she said to Lulu,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am sorry that you told me this, sorry you knew it
to tell. It was wrong in you to listen, and you must not
repeat it to any one else. Will you promise?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Lulu would do anything which Alice asked, and she
gave the required promise, then with terror in every lineament
of her face she said,</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, Miss Alice, must I be Miss ’Lina’s waiting-maid?
Will Master Hugh permit it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice did not know Hugh as well as we do, and in her
heart there was a fear lest for the sake of peace he might
be overruled, resolving in her mind that Lulu and Muggins
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>should change owners ere the capricious ’Lina’s return,
and endeavoring as far as she could to quiet both.
It was no easy task, however, to soothe Muggins,
and only Alice’s direct avowal that if possible she
would herself become her purchaser, checked her cries at
all, but the moment this was said her sobbing ceased, and
Alice was able to question Lulu as to whether it was really
Hugh who had read the letter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lulu assured her that it was, and feeling that he must
be better, Alice dismissed both Lulu and Mug, and then
sat down to reflect as to her next best course of action.</p>

<p class='c011'>Adah must go to Terrace Hill, and if Alice’s suspicions
were correct the projected marriage would be prevented
without further interference, for ’Lina was not bad enough
deliberately to take for a husband one who had so cruelly
wronged another, and even if she were, <em>Anna</em> had power
to stop it. Adah must go, and Alice’s must be the purse
which defrayed all the expense of fitting her up. If ever
Alice felt thankful to God for having made her rich in
this world’s goods, it was that morning when so many
calls for money seemed crowding on her at once. Only
the previous night she had heard from Col. Tiffton that
the day was fixed for the sale of his house, that he had
no hope of redeeming it, and that <em>Nell</em> had nearly cried
herself into a second fever at the thoughts of leaving
Mosside. “Then there’s <em>Rocket</em>,” the colonel had said,
“Hugh cannot buy him back, and he’s so bound up in
him too, poor Hugh,” and with quivering lip the colonel
had wrung Alice’s hand, hurrying off ere she had time to
suggest what all along had been in her mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It does not matter,” she thought. “A surprise will
be quite as pleasant, and then Mr. Liston may object to
it as a silly girl’s fancy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was the previous night, and now this morning
another demand had come in the shape of Muggins weeping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>in her lap, and Lulu begging to be saved from ’Lina
Worthington.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meantime in the sick room there was a consultation
between mother and son, touching the money for which
’Lina had asked, and which Hugh declined sending to
her. She had shown herself too heartless for any
thing, he said, and were it not for <em>Anna</em>, who was too
good to be so terribly duped, he should be glad when
that Dr. took her off his hands; then he spoke of Alice
asking many questions concerning her, and at last expressing
a wish to see, and talk with her. This wish
Mrs. Worthington at once communicated to Alice, who
rather reluctantly went to his room, feeling that it was
to all intents and purposes her first meeting with Hugh.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is Miss Johnson,” Mrs. Worthington said, as
Alice drew near, a bright flush spreading over her face
as she met Hugh’s look, expressive of more than gratitude.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I fancy I am to a certain degree indebted to Miss
Johnson for my life,” Hugh said, offering her his hand,
while he thanked her for her kindness to him during the
long weeks of his illness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was not wholly unconscious of your presence,” he
continued, still holding her hand. “There were moments
when I had a vague idea of somebody different from those
I have always known bending over me, and I fancied, too,
that this somebody was sent to save me from some great
evil. I am glad you were here, Miss Johnson; I shall not
forget your kindness.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He dropped her hand then, while Alice attempted to
stammer out some reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Adah, too, had been kind,” she said, “quite as kind as
herself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Adah is a dear, good girl,” Hugh replied. “She
is to me all a sister could be. Do you like Adah?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, very much.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>“I’m glad, for she is worthy of your love. She has
been terribly wronged, sometime she may tell you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She has told me,” Alice replied, while Hugh continued,
“I am sure you will respect her just the same.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice had not intended to talk with him of Adah then,
but he had introduced the subject and so she said to him,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I had thought to tell you of a plan which Mrs. Hastings
has in view, but perhaps, I had better wait till you
are stronger.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am strong enough now—stronger than you think.
Tell me of the plan,” and Hugh urged the request until
Alice told him of Terrace Hill and Adah’s wish to go
there.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a few minutes Hugh lay perfectly still. Once he
would have spurned the idea, for Spring Bank would be
so lonely without Adah and the little boy, but Alice was
there now; Alice was worth a dozen Adahs, and so he
said at last, “I have heard of the Richards family before.
You know the Dr. I believe. Do you like him? Is he a
man to be trusted?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I know Dr. Richards,” Alice replied, half resolving
to tell Hugh all she feared, but feeling that possibly
she might be wrong in her suspicions, she concluded not
to do so, Adah’s presence at Terrace Hill would settle that
matter, and she asked again if he did not think it well for
her to go.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, on some accounts,” Hugh answered, thinking of
’Lina. “But it looks too much like sending her out alone
into the world. Does she wish to go? Is she anxious?
Call her please. I would hear from her what she has to
say.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Adah came at once, advancing so many reasons why
she should go that Hugh consented at last, and it was
finally settled that she should leave as soon as the necessary
additions could be made to her own and Willie’s
wardrobe.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>This being arranged, Alice and Adah withdrew, and
Hugh was left alone to think over the incidents of his
interview with Alice. He had not expected her to recognize
him by his name, because she had not learned it when
on board the steamer, neither did he really expect her to
recognize his features, for he knew he had changed materially
since that time, still he was conscious of a feeling
of disappointment that she did not remember him, and
once he thought to tell her who he was, but he would
rather she should find that out herself; and while wondering
what she would do and say when it did come to her
knowledge that he was the lad who tried to save her life,
he fell away to sleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>Three weeks later there came another letter from ’Lina,
and with his mother sitting beside him, Hugh read it
aloud, learning “that Irving Stanley’s widowed sister, Mrs.
Carrie Ellsworth, was in New York and had come to the
hotel with her brother, that having an object in view ’Lina
had done her best to <em>cultivate</em> Mrs. Ellsworth, presuming
a great deal on their relationship, and making herself so
agreeable to her child, a most ugly piece of deformity,
that <em>cousin Carrie</em>, who had hired a furnished house for
the winter, had invited her to spend the season with her,
and she was now snugly ensconced in most delightful
quarters on Twenty-second street, between Fifth and Sixth
avenues. Sometimes,” she wrote, “I half suspect Mrs.
Ellsworth did not think I would jump at her invitation so
quick, but I don’t care. The doctor, for some reason or
other, has deferred our marriage until spring, and dear
knows I am not coming to Spring Bank any sooner than
I can help. The doctor, of course, would insist upon accompanying
me, and that would explode my bubble at
once. When I am ready to return, Hugh must do the
brotherly, and come for me, so that the first inkling the
doctor gets of Spring Bank will be when he comes to
have tied the nuptial knot. I’m half sorry to think how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>disappointed he will be, for I begin to like him, and mean
to make up in goodness what I lack in gold.</p>

<p class='c011'>“By the way, Adah must <em>not</em> go to Terrace Hill as
you wrote she thought of doing. You are crazy to think of
it, of course they would quiz her to death about me and
Spring Bank. So tie her up, or throttle her, or do some
thing if she persists in going.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall buy my bridal trousseau under Mrs. Ellsworth’s
supervision. She has exquisite taste, and Hugh must
send the money. As I told him before, he can sell Mug.
Harney will buy her. He likes pretty darkies.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, horror! can Ad be a woman, with womanly feelings!”
Hugh exclaimed, as he deliberately tore the letter
in fragments, and scattered them over the floor, feeling
for a moment as if he hated his sister.</p>

<p class='c011'>But he struggled hard to cast the bitterness away, and
after a moment was able to listen and answer calmly,
while his mother asked if it would not be better to persuade
Adah not to go to Terrace Hill.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It may interfere with ’Lina’s plans,” she said, “and
now it’s gone so far, it seems a pity to have it broken up.
I know it is not right to deceive him so, but—but—I
don’t know what. It’s—it’s very pleasant with ’Lina
gone,” and with a choking sob, Mrs. Worthington laid
her face upon the pillow, ashamed and sorry that the
real sentiments of her heart were thus laid bare.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was terrible for a mother to feel that her home
would be happier for the absence of an only daughter,
but she did feel so, and it made her half willing that Dr.
Richards should be deceived. But Hugh shrank from
the dishonorable proceeding. He would not interfere
himself, but if Adah could be the agent through whose
instrumentality the fraud was prevented, he would be
glad, and he answered decidedly that “She must go.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Worthington always yielded to Hugh, and she
did so now, mentally resolving, however, to say a few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>words to Adah, relative to her not divulging anything
which could possibly harm ’Lina, such as telling how
poor they were, or anything like that. This done, Mrs.
Worthington felt easier, and as Hugh looked tired and
worried, she left him for a time, having first called Muggins
to gather up the fragments of ’Lina’s letter which
Hugh had thrown upon the carpet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, burn every trace of it,” Hugh said, watching the
child as she picked up piece by piece, and threw them
into the grate.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I means to save dat ar. I’ll play I has a letter for
Miss Alice,” Mug thought, as she came upon a bit larger
than the others, and when she left the room there was
hidden in her bosom that part of ’Lina’s letter relating
to herself and Harney.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXIII.<br> <span class='large'>THE SALE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Col. Tiffton could not pay the $10,000 note which he
had foolishly endorsed, and as Harney knew no mercy
where his interest was concerned. Mosside must be sold;
and the day of the sale had come. There was a crowd
of people out and they waited anxiously for the shrill
voice and hammer of the auctioneer, a portly little man,
who felt more for the family than his appearance would
indicate.</p>

<p class='c011'>There had been a long talk that morning between him
self and a young lady, whose beauty had thrilled his heart
just as it did every heart beating beneath a male’s attire.
The lady had seemed a little nervous, as she talked, casting
anxious glances up the Lexington turnpike, and asking
several times when the Lexington cars were due.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>“It shan’t make no difference. I’ll take your word,” the
auctioneer had said in reply to some doubts expressed by
her. “I’d trust your face for a million,” and with a profound
bow by way of emphasising his compliment, the well
meaning Skinner went out to the group assembled in the
yard, while the lady returned to the upper chamber where
Mrs. Tiffton and Ellen were weeping bitterly and refusing
to be comforted.</p>

<p class='c011'>From Ellen’s chamber a small glass door opened out
upon an open balcony, where the Colonel sat leaning on
his cane, and watching the movements in the yard below.
To this balcony, and the glass door communicating with
it, many eyes were directed, for it was known the family
were in that vicinity, and it was also whispered that Miss
Johnson, the beautiful young lady from Spring Bank was
there, and great was the anxiety of some for a sight of
her. But neither Ellen nor Alice were visible for the first
hour, and only the white-haired colonel kept watch while
one after another of his household goods were sold.</p>

<p class='c011'>The crowd grew weary at last—they must have brisker
sport, if they would keep warm in that chilly November
wind, and cries for the “horses” were heard.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your crack ones, too. I’m tired of this,” growled
Harney, and Ellen’s riding pony was led out, the one she
loved and petted almost as much as Hugh had petted
Rocket. The Colonel saw the playful animal, and with
a moan tottered to Ellen’s chamber, saying,</p>

<p class='c011'>“They are going to sell Beauty, Nell. Poor Nellie,
don’t cry,” and the old man laid his hand on his weeping
daughter’s head.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Colonel Tiffton, this way please,” and Alice spoke in
a whisper. “I want Beauty, and I expected—I thought—”
here she glanced again up the turnpike, but seeing
no one continued, “Couldn’t you bid for me, bid all you
would be willing to give if you were bidding for Ellen?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The colonel looked at her in a kind of dazed, bewildered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>way, as if not fully comprehending her, till she repeated
her request; then mechanically he went back to
his post on the balcony, and just as Harney’s last bid was
about to receive the final <em>gone</em>, he raised it twenty dollars
and ere Harney had time to recover his astonishment,
Beauty was disposed of, and the Colonel’s servant Ham
led her in triumph back to the stable.</p>

<p class='c011'>With a fierce scowl of defiance Harney called for Rocket.
He had not forgotten that knock-down months before,
when Hugh resented the insult offered to Adah Hastings.
He had hated him ever since—had sworn to have revenge,
and as one mode of taking it, he would secure Rocket at
all hazards. Even that morning as he rode past Spring
Bank, he had thought with a fiendish exultation, how he
would seek the opportunity to provoke to restlessness and
then cowhide Rocket in Hugh’s presence as a means of
repaying the knock-down! And this was the savage,
who, with eager, expectant look upon his visage, stood
waiting for Rocket.</p>

<p class='c011'>Suspecting something wrong the animal refused to come
out, and planting his fore feet firmly upon the floor of his
stable, kept them all at bay. With a fierce oath, the brutal
Harney gave him a stinging blow, which made the tender
flesh quiver with pain, but the fiery gleam in the animal’s
eye warned him not to repeat it. Suddenly among
the excited group of dusky faces he spied that of <em>Claib</em>,
and bade him lead out the horse.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can’t. Oh, mars’r, for the dear ——” Claib began,
but Harney’s riding whip silenced him and he went submissively
in to Rocket, who became as gentle beneath his
touch as a lamb.</p>

<p class='c011'>Loud were the cries of admiration which hailed his appearance;
and Alice would have known that something
important was pending without the colonel’s groan,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Rocket! Poor Hugh! It hurts me for the boy
more than anything else!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>With one last despairing glance up the still lonely ‘pike
Alice hurried to the door, and looked out upon the eager
throng. Gathered in a knot around Rocket were all the
noted horse-dealers of the country, and conspicuous among
them was Harney, his face wearing a most disagreeable
expression, as in reply to some remark of one of his companions
he said, by way of depreciating Rocket, and thus
preventing bids.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, quite a fancy piece, but ain’t worth a row of pins.
Been fed with sugar plums too much. Why, it will take
all the gads in Kentucky to break him in.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The bids were very rapid, for Rocket was popular, but
Harney bided his time, standing silently by, with a look
on his face of cool contempt for those who presumed to
think they could be the fortunate ones. He was prepared
to give more than any one else. Nobody would go above
his figure, he had set it so high—higher even than Rocket
was really worth. Five hundred and fifty, if necessary.
No one would rise above that, Harney was sure, and
he quietly waited until the bids were far between, and the
auctioneer still dwelling upon the last, seemed waiting expectantly
for something.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I believe my soul the fellow knows I mean to have
that horse,” thought Harney, and with an air which said,
“that settles it,” he called out in loud, clear tones, “Four
Hundred,” thus adding fifty at one bid.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a slight movement then in the upper balcony,
an opening of the glass door, and a suppressed whisper
ran through the crowd, as <em>Alice</em> came out and stood
by the colonel’s side.</p>

<p class='c011'>The bidding went on briskly now, each bidder raising
a few dollars, till $450 were reached, and then there
came a pause, broken at last by a silvery half-tremulous
voice, which passed like an electric shock through the
eager crowd, and roused Harney to a perfect fury.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Five Hundred.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>There was no mistaking the words, and with a muttered
curse Harney yelled out his price, all he had meant
to give. Again that girlish voice was heard, this time
clear and decisive as it added ten to Harney’s five hundred
and fifty. Harney knew now who it was that bid against
him, for, following the eyes of those around him, he saw
her where she stood, her long curls blowing about her
fair, flushed face, one little hand resting on the colonel’s
shoulder, the other holding together Ellen Tiffton’s crimson
scarf, which she had thrown over her black dress to
shield her from the cold. There was nothing immodest
or unmaidenly in her position, and no one felt that there
was. Profound respect and admiration were the only
feelings she elicited from the spectators, unless we except
the villain Harney, and even he stood gazing at her for a
moment, struck with her marvellous beauty, and the look
of quiet resolution upon her childish face. Had Alice
been told six months before that she would one day
mingle conspicuously in a Kentucky horse-sale as the
competitor of such a man as Harney, she would have
scoffed at the idea, and even now she had no distinct
consciousness of what she was doing.</p>

<p class='c011'>Up to the latest possible moment she had watched the
distant highway, and when there was no longer hope,
had stolen to the colonel’s side, and whispered in his ear
what he must say.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It will not do for me,” he replied. “Say it yourself.
There’s no impropriety,” and, almost ere she was aware
of it, Alice’s voice joined itself with the din which ceased
as her distinct “Five Hundred” came ringing through
the air.</p>

<p class='c011'>Harney was mad with rage for he knew well for whom
that fair Northern girl was interested. He had heard
that she was rich—how rich he did not know—but
fancied she might possibly be worth a few paltry
thousands, and so, of course she was not prepared to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>compete with him, who counted his gold by hundreds of
thousands. Five hundred was all she would give for
Rocket. How, then, was he surprised and chagrined
when, with a coolness equal to his own, she kept steadily
on, scarcely allowing the auctioneer to repeat his bid before
she increased it and once, womanlike, raising on her
own.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fie, Harney! Shame to go against a girl! Better
give it up, for don’t you see she’s resolved to have him?
She’s worth half Massachusetts, too, they say.”</p>

<p class='c011'>These and like expressions met Harney on every side
until at last, as he paused to answer some of them, growing
heated in the altercation, and for the instant forgetting
Rocket, the auctioneer brought the hammer down
with a click which made Harney leap from the ground,
for by that sound he knew that Rocket was sold to Alice
Johnson for six hundred dollars! There was a horrid oath,
a fierce scowl at Alice passing from his view, and then,
with the muttered sneer, “I wonder if she intends to buy
the farm and niggers?” Harney tried to hide his discomfiture
by saying, “he was glad on the whole, for he did
not really want the horse, and had only bidden from
spite!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Meantime Alice had sought the friendly shelter of Ellen’s
room, where the tension of nerve endured so long
gave way, and sinking upon the sofa she fainted just as
down the Lexington turnpike came the man looked for so
long in the earlier part of the day. Alice had written to
Mr. Liston a few weeks previous to the sale, and indulgent
almost to a fault to his beautiful ward, he had replied
that he would surely be at Mosside in time.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had kept his word, and it was his familiar voice
which brought Alice back to consciousness; and pressing
his hand, she told him what she had done, and asked if it
were unmaidenly. She could not err, in Mr. Liston’s estimation,
and with his assurance that all was right, Alice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>grew calm, and in a hurried consultation explained to him
more definitely than her letter had done, what her wishes
were—Colonel Tiffton must not be homeless in his old
age. There were 10,000 dollars lying in the —— Bank in
Massachusetts, and she would have Mosside purchased in
her name for Colonel Tiffton, not as a gift, for he would
not accept it, but as a loan, to be paid at his convenience.
This was Alice’s plan, and Mr. Liston acted upon it at
once. Taking his place in the motley assemblage, he bid
quietly, steadily, until the whisper ran round, “Who is
that man in that butternut-colored coat?”</p>

<p class='c011'>None knew who he was though all came to the conclusion
that Harney’s hope of securing Mosside was as futile
as had been his hope of getting Rocket. There were
others disappointed, too—the fair matrons who coveted
Mrs. Tiffton’s carpets, mirrors, and cut-glass, all of which
passed to the stranger. When it came to the negroes he
winced a little, wondering what his abolition friends would
say to see him bidding off his own flesh and blood, but
the end answered the means, he thought, and so he kept
on until at last Mosside, with its appurtenances, belonged
ostensibly to him, and the half glad, half disappointed
people wondered greatly who <em>Mr. Jacob Liston</em> could be,
or from what quarter of the globe he had suddenly dropped
into their midst.</p>

<p class='c011'>Col. Tiffton knew that nearly every thing had been purchased
by him, and felt glad that a stranger rather than
a neighbor was to occupy what had been so dear to him,
and that his servants would not be separated. With Ellen
it was different. A neighbor might allow them to remain
there a time, she said, while a stranger would not,
and she was weeping bitterly, when, as the sound of
voices and the tread of feet gradually died away from the
yard below, Alice came to her side, and bending over her
said softly, “Could you bear some good news now;—bear
to know who is to inhabit Mosside?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>“Good news?” and Ellen looked up wonderingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, good news, I think you will call it,” and then as
delicately as possible Alice told what had been done, and
that the colonel was still to occupy his old home. “As
my tenant, if you like,” she said to him, when he began
to demur. “You will not find me a hard landlady,” and
with playful raillery she succeeded in bringing a smile to
his face, where tears also were visible.</p>

<p class='c011'>When at last it was clear to the old man, he laid his
hand upon the head of the young girl and whispered
huskily, “I cannot thank you as I would, or tell you
what’s in my heart. God bless you, Alice Johnson. I
wish I too, had found him early as you have, for I know
it’s He that put this into your mind. God bless you, God
bless my child.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXIV.<br> <span class='large'>THE RIDE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>That night after her return from Mosside, Alice had
playfully remarked to Hugh, “The Doctor says you stay
too closely in the house. You need more exercise, and
to-morrow I am going to coax you to ride with me, I am
getting quite proud of my horsemanship, and want your
opinion, I shall not take an excuse. You are mine for a
part of to-morrow,” she added, as she saw him about to
speak, and casting upon him her most bewildering smile,
he hastily quitted the room, but not until she heard his
muttered sigh and guessed that he was thinking of Rocket.
He had not asked a question concerning Mosside, and
only knew that a stranger had bought it with all its appurtenances.
Rocket he had not mentioned, though his
pet was really uppermost in his mind, and when he woke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>next morning from his feverish sleep and remembered
Alice’s proposal to ride, he said to himself, “I cannot go,
much as I might enjoy it. No other horse would carry
me as gently as Rocket. Oh, Rocket!”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was always the despairing cry with which Hugh
ended his cogitation of Rocket, and he said it now bitterly,
without the shadow of a hope.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a bright, balmy morning, unlike the chilly one
of the previous day, and Hugh, as he walked slowly to
the window and inhaled the fragrant air, felt that it would
do him good. “But I shan’t go,” he said, and when, after
breakfast was over, Alice came, reminding him of the
ride, telling him she was going then to get herself in
readiness, and should expect to find him waiting when
she came back, he began an excuse, but his resolution
quickly gave way before her sprightly arguments, and he
finally assented, saying, however, by way of apology, “You
must not expect a gay cavalier, for I am still too weak, and
I have no horse fit to ride.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I know,” and Alice ran gaily to her room and
donned her riding dress, while not less eager than herself,
Mrs. Worthington, Aunt Eunice, and Adah stood by, wondering
what Hugh would say and how Rocket would act.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was out in the back yard now, pawing and curvetting,
and rubbing his nose against all who came near him,
while Claib, never so happy in his life, was holding him
by his bridle and talking to him of Mars’r Hugh, which
name the animal was supposed to recognize.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There, I’m ready,” Alice said, running down to Hugh,
who was so pale, that but for the surprise in store for
him, Alice’s kind heart would at once have prompted he
do give up the project.</p>

<p class='c011'>With a sigh Hugh rose and followed her to the door
where Dido, held by Lulu, stood waiting for them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where’s Jim?” Hugh asked, glancing round in
quest of the huge animal he expected to mount.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>“Claib has your horse. He’s coming,” and with great
apparent unconcern Alice worked industriously at one
of her gauntlets, which obstinately refused to be buttoned,
while the entire household including Mr. Liston, who had
come to Spring Bank with Alice, congregated upon the
piazza, waiting anxiously for Rocket.</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly Adah flew to Hugh’s side, and said, eagerly,
“Hugh, please whistle as you used to do for Rocket—just
once, and let Miss Johnson hear you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hugh felt as if she were mocking him, and answered
no, but when Alice added her entreaties to Adah’s, and
even laid her hand coaxingly on his arm, he yielded,
while like a gleam of lightning the shadow of a suspicion
flitted across his mind. It was a loud, shrill whistle, penetrating
even to the woods, and as it had never yet failed
of its object, so it did not now, for the instant the old familiar
sound fell on Rocket’s ear he started as if a shell
had exploded beneath his feet, and breaking away from
Claib went tearing round the house, answering that call
with the neigh he had been wont to give when summoned
by his master. Utterly speechless Hugh stood
gazing at him as he came up, his neck arched proudly,
and his silken mane flowing as gracefully as on the day
when he was led away to Col. Tiffton’s stall.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mother, what does it mean—oh, mother!” and leaning
himself against the pillar of the piazza for support,
Hugh turned to his mother for an explanation, but she
did not heed him, so intent was she in watching Rocket,
who had reached his master, and seemed to be regarding
him in some perplexity, as if puzzled at his changed
appearance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Possibly pity is an emotion unknown to the brute creation,
but surely if pity can be felt by them, it was expressed
by Rocket, as he stood eyeing his pale, wasted
young master; then, with a low cry of joy, he lifted his
head to Hugh’s face, and rubbed against it, trying in various
ways to evince his delight at seeing him again.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>“Won’t anybody tell me what it means?” Hugh gasped,
stretching out his hands towards Rocket, who even
attempted to lick them.</p>

<p class='c011'>At this point Alice stepped forward, and taking Rocket’s
bridle, laid it across Hugh’s lap, saying, softly—</p>

<p class='c011'>“It means that Rocket is yours, purchased by a friend,
saved from Harney, for you. Mount him, and see if he
rides as easily as ever. I am impatient to be off.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But had Hugh’s life depended upon it, he could not
have mounted Rocket then. He knew the friend was Alice,
and the magnitude of the act overpowered him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Miss Johnson,” he cried, “what made you do it?
It must not be. I cannot suffer it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not to please me?” and Alice’s face wore its most
winning look. “It’s been my fixed determination ever
since I heard of Rocket, and knew how much you loved
him. I was never so happy doing an act in my life, and
you must not spoil it all by refusing. Mr. Liston knew
and approved of my doing it,” and she turned to her
guardian, who advanced towards Hugh, and in a few low-spoken
words told him how Alice’s heart had been set
upon redeeming Rocket, and how hurt she would be if
Hugh did not accept him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As a loan then, not as a gift,” Hugh whispered. “It
shall not be a gift.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It need not,” Alice rejoined, “You shall pay for Rocket
if you like, and I’ll tell you how on our ride. Shall
we go?”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no longer an excuse for lingering, and with
Claib’s help Hugh was once more seated in his saddle
while Rocket’s whole frame quivered with apparent joy
at bearing his young master again. They made a splendid
looking couple on horseback, and the family watched
them admiringly until Hugh, feeling stronger with every
breath he drew, struck into a gentle canter, and the hill
hid them from view.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>Once out upon the highway where there were no mud
holes to shun, no gates to open and shut, Hugh broached
the subject of Rocket again, when Alice told him unhesitatingly
how he could, if he would, pay for him and leave
her greatly his debtor. The scrap of paper, which Muggins
had saved from the letter thrown by Hugh upon the
carpet, had been placed by the queer little child in an old
envelope, which she called her letter to Miss Alice.
Handing it to her with the utmost gravity she had asked
her to read “Mug’s letter,” and Alice had read the brief
lines written by ’Lina, “Hugh must send the money, as I
told him before. He can sell Mug, Harney likes pretty
darkies.” There was a cold, sick feeling at Alice’s heart,
a shrinking with horror from ’Lina Worthington, and then
she came to a decision. Mug should be hers, and so, as
skillfully as she could she brought it round, that having
taken a great fancy both to Lulu and Muggins, she wished
to buy them both, giving whatever Hugh honestly thought
they were worth. Rocket, if he pleased, should be taken
as part or whole payment for Mug, and so cease to be a
gift.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hugh was confounded. Could Alice know what ’Lina
had written? It did not seem possible, and yet she had
laid her hand upon the very dilemma which was troubling
him so much. If <em>Ad</em> should marry that doctor, she would
want money as she had said, and money Hugh could not
get unless he sold his negroes. He had said he never
would part with them; but selling them to Alice was virtually
setting them at liberty, and Hugh felt his own
heart throb as he thought of Mug’s delight when told
that she was free. A slave master can love his bond servant,
and Hugh loved the little Mug so much that the
idea of parting with her as he surely must at some future
time if he assented to Alice’s plan, made him hesitate, and
Alice’s best arguments were called into requisition ere he
came to a decision. But he decided at last, influenced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>not so much by need of money as by knowing how much
real good the exchange of ownership would do to the two
young girls. In return for Rocket Alice should have
Muggins, while for Lulu she might give what she liked.
Seven hundred, he had been offered, but he would take
less.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Heaven knows,” he added, as he saw by the expression
of Alice’s face how distasteful to her was the whole
idea of bargaining for human flesh and blood, “Heaven
knows it is not my nature to hold any one in bondage, and
I shall gladly hail the day which sees the negro free. But
I cannot now help myself more than others around me.
Our slaves are our property. Take them from us and we
are ruined wholly. Miss Johnson, do you honestly believe
that one in forty of those northern abolitionists would deliberately
give up ten—twenty—fifty thousand dollars
as the case might be, just because the thing valued at that
was man and not beast? No, indeed. It’s very easy for
them to tell what must be done, but hard finding one to
do it. Southern people, born and brought up in the midst
of slavery can’t see it as the North do, and there’s where
the mischief lies. Neither understands the other, and I
greatly fear the day is not far distant when our fair Union
shall be torn in tatters by enraged and furious brothers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He had wandered from Lulu and Muggins to the subject
which then, far more than the North believed, was
agitating the Southern mind, but Alice, more interested
in her purchases than in Secession, of which she had no
fears, brought him back to the point, by suggesting that
the necessary papers be made out at once, so there could
be no mistake.</p>

<p class='c011'>They had ridden far enough by this time, for Hugh was
beginning to look tired, and so they turned their horses
homeward, talking pleasantly of whatever presented itself
to Alice’s mind. Once as Hugh gave her a look which
had often puzzled and mystified her, she said, “Do you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>know it seems to me I must have seen you before I came
to Kentucky, for at times there is something very familiar
in your face.”</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment Hugh was tempted to tell her where
they had met before, but feeling that he was not quite
ready yet to do so, he refrained, and making her some
evasive reply, relapsed into a thoughtful mood which continued
until Spring Bank was reached.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXV.<br> <span class='large'>HUGH AND ALICE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Three weeks had passed away since that memorable
ride. Mr. Liston after paying to the proper recipients the
money due for Mosside, had returned to Boston, leaving
the neighborhood to gossip of Alice’s generosity, and to
wonder how much she was worth. It was a secret yet
that Lulu and Muggins were hers, but the story of Rocket
was known, and numerous were the surmises as to what
would be the result of her familiar intercourse with Hugh.
Already was the effect of her presence visible in his gentleness
of manner, his care to observe all the little points
of etiquette never practiced by him before, and his attention
to his own personal appearance. His trousers were no
longer worn inside his boots, or his soft hat jammed into
every conceivable shape, while Ellen Tiffton, who came
often to Spring Bank, and was supposed to be good authority,
pronounced him almost as stylish looking as any man
in Woodford.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is strange how much dress and a little care as to its
adjustment can do for one. It certainly did wonders for
Hugh, who knew how much he was improved, and to whose
influence he owed it, just as he knew of the mighty love
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>he bore this gentle girl, working so great a good at Spring
Bank.</p>

<p class='c011'>To Hugh, Alice was every thing, and sometimes the
thought crossed his mind that possibly he might win her
for himself, but it was repudiated as soon as formed, for it
could not be, he said, that one like Alice Johnson should
ever care for him; and so, between hope and a kind of
blissful despair, Hugh lived on until the evening of the day
when Adah left Spring Bank for Terrace Hill. She had
intended going immediately after the sale at Mosside, but
Willie had been ailing ever since, and that had detained
her. But now she was really gone; Hugh had accompanied
her to Frankfort, seeing her safely off, and spending the
entire day in town, so that it was rather late when he returned
to Spring Bank. Being unusually fatigued Mrs.
Worthington had already retired and as Alice was not in
sight, Hugh sat down alone by the parlor fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was sorry Adah was gone and he missed her sadly,
but it was not so much of her he was thinking as of Alice.
During the last few days she had puzzled him greatly.
Her manner had been unusually kind, her voice unusually
soft and low when she addressed him, while several
times he had met her eyes fixed upon him with an
expression he could not fathom, and which had made his
heart beat high as hope whispered of what might perhaps
be, in spite of all his fears. Poor Hugh! he never dreamed
that Alice’s real feelings towards him during those
few days were those of pity, as she saw how silent and
moody he grew, and attributed it to his grief at parting
with Adah. She was of course very dear to him, she
supposed, and Alice’s kind heart went out toward him
with a strong desire to comfort him, to tell him how she,
as far as possible, would fill Adah’s place. Had she dreamed
of his real feelings, she never would have done what
she did, but she was wholly unconscious of it, and so
when, late that night, she returned to the parlor in quest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>of something she had left, and found him sitting there
alone, she paused a moment on the threshold, wondering
if she had better join him or go away. His back was toward
her, and he did not hear her light step, so intently
was he gazing into the burning grate, and trying to frame
the words he should say if ever he dared tell Alice Johnson
of his love.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was much girlish playfulness in Alice’s nature,
and gliding across the carpet, she clasped both her hands
before his eyes, and exclaimed—</p>

<p class='c011'>“A penny for your thoughts.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hugh started as suddenly as if some apparition had
appeared before him, and blushing guiltily, clasped and
held upon his face the little soft, warm hands which did
not tremble, but lay still beneath his own. It was Providence
which sent her there, he thought; Providence indicating
that he might speak, and he would.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am glad you have come. I wish to talk with you,”
he said, drawing her down into a chair beside him, and
placing his arm lightly across its back. “What sent you
here, Alice? I supposed you had retired,” he continued,
bending upon her a look which made her slightly uncomfortable.</p>

<p class='c011'>But she soon recovered, and answered laughingly—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I came for my scissors, and finding you here alone,
thought I would startle you, but you have not told me
yet of what you were thinking.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of the present, past and future,” he replied; then
letting his hand drop from the back of the chair upon
her shoulder, he continued, “May I talk freely with you?
May I tell you of myself, what I was, what I am, what I
hope to be?”</p>

<p class='c011'>His hand upon her shoulder made Alice a little uneasy
but he had put it there in such a quiet, matter of course
way, that he might think her prudish if she objected.
Still her cheeks burned, and her voice was not quite
steady, as, rising from her seat, she said,</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>“I like a stool better than this chair. I’ll bring it and
sit at your feet. There, now I am ready;” and seating
herself at a safe distance from him, Alice waited for him
to commence.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Hugh was in no hurry then; that little act of
hers had chilled him somewhat. Perhaps she did not
like his arm around her, perhaps she never would,
and that was the saddest thought of all. She had never
looked to him as she did to-night, sitting there beside
him with the firelight falling upon her bright fair hair
curling so gracefully about her forehead and neck.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the high mantel a large mirror was standing, and
glancing towards it, Hugh caught the reflection of both
their figures, and with his usual depreciation of himself;
felt the contrast bitterly. This beautiful young girl
could not care for him; it were folly to think of it, and
he sat for a moment silent, forgetting that Alice was
waiting for him to speak. She grew tired of waiting at
last, and turning her eyes upon him, said gently,</p>

<p class='c011'>“You seem unhappy about something. Is it because
Adah has gone? I am sorry, too; but, Hugh, I will do
what I can to fill her place. I will be the sister you
need so much. Don’t look so wretched; it makes me feel
badly to see you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice’s sympathy was getting the better of her again,
and she moved her stool nearer to Hugh, while she involuntarily
laid her hand upon his knee. That decided
him; and while his heart throbbed almost to bursting, he
began by saying,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am in rather a gloomy mood to-night, I’ll admit. I
do feel Adah’s leaving us very much; but that is not all.
I have wished to talk with you a long time—wished to
tell you how I feel. May I, Alice?—may I open to you
my whole heart, and show you what is there?”</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment Alice felt a thrill of fear—a dread of
what the opening of his heart to her might disclose.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>Then she remembered Golden Hair, whose name she had
never heard him breathe, save as it passed his delirious
lips. It was of her he would talk; he would tell her of
that hidden love whose existence she felt sure was not
known at Spring Bank. Alice would rather not have
had this confidence, for the deep love-life of such as,
Hugh Worthington seemed to her a sacred thing; but he
looked so white, so care-worn, so much as if it would be
a relief, that Alice answered at last:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Hugh, you may tell, and I will listen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She moved her stool still nearer to him, beginning now
to feel anxious herself to hear of one whose very memory
had influenced Hugh for good.</p>

<p class='c011'>So sure was Alice that it was Golden Hair of whom he
would talk, that when, by way of a commencement, he
said to her, “Can you guess what I would tell you?” she
answered involuntarily:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I guess it is of somebody you have loved, or do love
still.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no tremor in her voice, no flush in her cheek,
no drooping of the long lashes to cover her confusion;
and yet deluded Hugh believed she knew his secret, and
alas! believed his love reciprocated; else why should she
thus encourage him to go on! It was the happiest moment
Hugh had ever known, and for a time he could not
speak, as he thought how strange it was that a joy so
perfect as this should come to be his lot. Poor, poor
Hugh!</p>

<p class='c011'>He began at last by telling Alice of his early boyhood,
uncheered by a single word of sympathy save as it came
from dear Aunt Eunice, who alone understood the wayward
boy whom people thought so bad.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then mother and Ad came to Spring Bank, and
that opened to me a new era. In my odd way, I loved
my mother so much—but <em>Ad</em>—say, Alice, is it wicked
in me if I can’t love Ad?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>“She is your sister,” was Alice’s reply; and Hugh rejoined:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes—my sister. I’m sorry for it, even if it’s wicked
to be sorry. I tried to do my best with her—tried to be
as gentle as I could; but she did not understand me.
She gave me back only scorn and bitter words, until my
heart closed up against her, and I harshly judged all others
by her—all but one”; and Hugh’s voice grew very
low and tender in its tone, while Alice felt that now he
was nearing the Golden Hair.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Away off in New England there was a pure white
blossom growing, a blossom so pure, so fair, that very
few were worthy even so much as to look upon it, as
day by day it unfolded some new beauty. There was
nothing to support this flower but a single parent stalk,
which snapped asunder one day, and Blossom was left
alone. It was a strange idea, transplanting it to another
soil; for the atmosphere of Spring Bank was not suited
to such as she. But she came, and, as by magic, the
whole atmosphere was changed—changed at least to one—the
bad, wayward Hugh, who dared to love this fair
young girl with a love stronger than his life. For her he
would do anything, and beneath her influence he did improve
rapidly. He was conscious of it himself—conscious
of a greater degree of self-respect—a desire to be what
she would like to have him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She was very, very beautiful; more so than anything
Hugh had ever looked upon. Her face was like an angel’s
face, and her hair—much like yours, Alice;” and he laid
his hand on the bright head, now bent down, so that he
could not see that face so like an angel’s.</p>

<p class='c011'>The little hand, too, had slidden from his knee, and,
fast-locked within the other, was buried in Alice’s lap, as
she listened with throbbing heart to the story Hugh was
telling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In all the world there was nothing so dear to Hugh as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>this young girl. He thought of her by day and dreamed
of her by night, seeing always in the darkness her face,
with its eyes of blue bending over him—hearing the music
of her voice, like the falling of distant water, and even
feeling the soft touch of her hands as he fancied them
laid upon his brow. She was good, too, as beautiful; and
it was this very goodness which won on Hugh so fast,
making him pray often that he might be worthy of her—for,
Alice, he came at last to dream that he could win
her; she was so kind to him—she spoke to him so softly
and, by a thousand little acts, endeared herself to him
more and more.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Heaven forgive her if she misled him all this while;
but she did not. It were worse than death to think she
did—to know I’ve told her this in vain—have offered her
my heart only to have it thrust back upon me as something
she does not want. Speak, Alice! in mercy, speak!
Can it be that I’m mistaken?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Something in her manner had wrung out this cry of fear
and now, bending over her as she sat with her face buried
in her lap he waited for her answer. It had come like a
thunderbolt to Alice, that she, and not Golden Hair, was
the subject of his story—she the fair blossom growing
among the New England hills. She did not guess that
they were one and the same, for Hugh would not have
her swayed ever so slightly by gratitude.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice saw how she had led him on, and her white lips
quivered with pain, for, alas! she did not love him as he
should be loved, and she could not deceive him, though
every fibre of her heart bled and ached for him. Lifting
up her head at last she exclaimed,</p>

<p class='c011'>“You don’t mean me, Hugh? Oh, you don’t mean
me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, darling,” and he clasped in his own the hand
raised imploringly toward him. “Yes, darling, I mean
you. I love you and you must be mine. I shall die without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>you. You can mould me at your will. You can
teach me the narrow way I want to find, Alice, more
than you guess. We will walk it hand in hand, yours
the stronger one at first, mine the stronger last, when
I’ve been taught by you. Will you, Alice, will you be
my wife, my darling, my idol? I know I have no
money, just as I know you do not care for that. You
will not prize me less for daring to ask you, an heiress, to
be mine. I have no money, no position, but I have willing
hands and a loving heart, which will answer in their
stead. Will you be my wife?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice had never before heard a voice so earnest, so full
of meaning, as the one now pleading with her to be what
she could not be, and a pang keener than any she had
ever felt, or believed it possible for her to feel, shot
through her heart as the dread conviction was forced
upon her that she was to blame for all this. She had
misled him, unwittingly, it is true, but that did not help
him now; the harm, the wrong were just the same, and
they loomed up before her in all their appalling magnitude.
What could she do to atone? Alas! there was
nothing except to be what he asked, and that she could not
do. She could not be Hugh’s wife. She would as soon
have married her brother, if she had one. But she must
do something, and sliding from her stool she sank upon
her knees—her proper attitude—upon her knees before
Hugh, whom she had wronged so terribly, and burying
her face in Hugh’s own hands, she sobbed,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Hugh, Hugh, you don’t know what you ask. I
love you dearly, but only as my brother—believe me,
Hugh, only as a brother. I wanted one so much—one
of my own, I mean; but God denied that wish, and gave
me you instead. I did not like you at first—that is, before
I saw you. I was sorry you were here, but I got
over that. I pitied first, and then I came to like or love
you so much, but only as my brother; and if I let you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>see that love, it was because it is my nature to caress
those whom I love—because I thought you understood
that ’twas only as my brother. I cannot be your wife.
I—oh, Hugh, forgive me for making you so unhappy.
I’m sorry I ever came here, but I cannot go away. I’ve
learned to love my Kentucky home. Let me stay just
the same. Let me really be what I thought I was, your
sister. You will not send me away?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She looked up at him now, but quickly turned away,
for the expression of his white, haggard face was more
than she could bear, and she knew there was a pain,
keener than any she had felt, a pang which must be terrible,
to crush a strong man as Hugh was crushed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Forgive me, Hugh,” she said, as he did not speak, but
sat gazing at her in a kind of stunned bewilderment.
“You would not have me for your wife, if I did not love
you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never, Alice, never!” he answered; “but it is not any
easier to bear. I don’t know why I asked you, why I
dared hope that you could think of me. I might have
known you could not. Nobody does. I cannot win their
love. I don’t know how.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He put her gently from him, and arose to leave the room,
but something mastered his will, and brought him back
again to where she knelt, her face upon his chair, as she
silently prayed to know just what was right. Something
she had said about his sending her away rang in his ears,
and he felt that the knowing she was gone would be the
bitterest dreg in all the bitter cup, so he said to her, entreatingly—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alice, I know you cannot be my wife—I do not expect
it now, but I want you here all the same. Promise
that you will stay, at least until my rival claims you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice neither looked up nor moved, only sobbed piteously,
and this more than aught else helped Hugh to
choke down his own sorrow for the sake of comforting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>her. The sight of her distress moved him greatly, for he
knew it was grief that she had so cruelly misled him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alice, darling,” he said again, this time as a mother
would soothe her child. “It hurts me more to see you
thus than your refusal did. I am not wholly selfish in
my love. I’d rather you should be happy than to be happy
myself. I would not for the world take to my bosom
an unwilling wife. I should be jealous even of my own
caresses, jealous lest the very act disgusted her more and
more. You did not mean to deceive me. It was I that
deceived myself. I forgive you fully, and ask you to forget
that to-night has ever been. It cut me sorely at first,
Alice, to hear you tell me so, but I shall get over it; the
wound will heal.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He said this falteringly, for the wound bled and throbbed
at every pore, but he would comfort her. She should
not know how much he suffered. “The wound will heal.
Even now I am feeling better, can almost see my way
through the darkness.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Poor Hugh! He mentally asked forgiveness for that
falsehood told for her. He could <em>not</em> see his way through,—his
brain was giddy, and his soul sick with that dull
dreadful pain which is so hard to be borne, but he could
hide his misery, for her sake, and he would.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Please, don’t cry,” he said, stooping over her, and
lifting her tenderly up. “I shall get over it. A man can
bear better than a woman, and even if I should not, I
would rather have loved and lost you, than not to have
known and loved you at all. The memory of what might
have been will keep me from much sin. There, darling,
let me wipe the tears away, let me hear you say you are
better.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Hugh, don’t, you break my heart. I’d rather
you should scorn or even hate me for the sorrow I have
brought. Such unselfish kindness will kill me,” Alice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>sobbed, for never had she been so touched as by this insight
into the real character of the man she had refused.</p>

<p class='c011'>He would not hold her long in his arms, though it were
bliss to do so, and putting her gently in the chair, he leaned
his own poor sick head upon the mantel, while Alice
watched him with streaming eyes and an aching heart
which even then half longed to give itself into his keeping.
She did not love him with a wife-like love, she knew
but she might in time, and she pitied him so much. And
Hugh had need for pity. He had tried to quiet her; had
said it was no matter, that he should get over it, that he
need not care, but the agony it cost him to say all this
was visible in every feature, and Alice looked at him with
wondering awe as he stood there silently battling with
the blow he would not permit to smite him down.</p>

<p class='c011'>At last it was Alice’s turn to speak, hers the task to
comfort. The prayer she had inwardly breathed for guidance
to act aright had not been unheard, and with a
strange calmness she arose, and laying her hand on Hugh’s
arm, bade him be seated, while she told him what she had
to say. He obeyed her, sinking into the offered chair,
and then standing before him, she began,</p>

<p class='c011'>“You do not wish me to go away, you say. I have no
desire to go, except it should be better for you. Even
though I may not be your wife, I can, perhaps, minister to
your happiness; and, Hugh, we will forget to-night, and
be to each other what we were before, brother and sister.
There must be no particular perceptible change of manner,
lest others should suspect what has passed between
us. Do you agree to this?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He bowed his head, and Alice drew a step nearer to
him, hesitating a moment ere she continued.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You speak of a rival. But believe me, Hugh, you
have none, there is not a man in the wide world whom I
like as much as I do you, and Hugh——” the little hand
pressed more closely on Hugh’s shoulder, while Alice’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>breath came heavily, “And, Hugh, it may be, that in time
I can conscientiously give you a different answer from
what I did to-night. I may love you as your wife should
love you; and—and, if I do, I’ll tell you so at the proper
time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a gleam of sunshine now to illumine the
thick darkness, and, in the first moments of his joy Hugh
wound his arm around the slight form, and tried to bring
it nearer to him. But Alice stepped back and answered,</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Hugh, that would be wrong. It may be I shall
never come to love you save as I love you now, but I’ll
try—I will try,” and unmindful of her charge to him
Alice parted the damp curls clustering around his forehead,
and looked into his face with an expression which
made his heart bound and throb with the sudden hope,
that even now she loved him better than she supposed.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was growing very late, and the clock in the adjoining
room struck one ere Alice bade Hugh good night, saying
to him,</p>

<p class='c011'>“No one must know of this. We’ll be just the same
to each other as we have been.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, just the same, if that can be,” Hugh answered,
and so they parted, Alice to her room, where, in the solitude,
she could pray for that guidance without which she
was nothing, and Hugh to his, where he, too, prayed, this
night with a greater earnestness than ever he had done
before—not for Golden Hair to come back, as of old,
but that he might be led into the path she trod, and so
be worthy of her, should the glad time ever come when
she might be his.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hugh had not yet learned the faith which asks for
good, that God shall be glorified rather than our own desires
fulfilled; but he who prays, ever so imperfectly, is
better for it, because the very act of praying implies a
faith in somebody to hear; and so soothed into comparative
quiet by the petition offered, Hugh fell into a quiet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>slumber, and slept on undisturbed until Muggins came to
wake him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXVI.<br> <span class='large'>ADAH’S JOURNEY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The night express from Rochester to Albany was crowded.
Every car was full, and the clamorous bell rang out
its first summons for all to get on board, just as a
frightened-looking woman, bearing in her arms a sleeping
boy, stepped upon the platform of the rear carriage, and
looked wistfully in at the long, dark line of passengers filling
every seat. Wearily, anxiously, she had passed
through every car, beginning at the first, her tired eyes
scanning each occupant, as if mutely begging some one
to have pity on her ere exhausted nature failed entirely,
and she sank fainting to the floor. None had heeded
that silent appeal, though many had marked the pallor
of her girlish face, and the extreme beauty of the baby
features nestling in her bosom. She could not hold out
much longer, and when she reached the last car and saw
that too was full, the chin quivered, and a tear glistened
in the long eyelashes, sweeping the colorless cheek.</p>

<p class='c011'>Slowly she passed up the aisle until she came to where
there was a vacant seat, only a gentleman’s shawl was
piled upon it, and the gentleman looking so unconcernedly
from the window, and apparently oblivious of her close
proximity to him, would not surely object to her sitting
there. How the tired woman did wish he would turn toward
her and give some token that she was welcome. But
no, his eyes were only intent on the darkness without; he
had no care for her, though he knew she was there. He
had seen the shrinking figure with its sleeping burden, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>it came in, and the selfishness which was so much a part
of his whole being, prompted him to cover the seat as far
as possible with his long limbs, while leaning his elbow
upon the window stool, he seemed absorbed in something
outside, peering into the foggy darkness, for it was a
rainy winter’s night, as persistently as if there were standing
before him no half-fainting form, ready to sink down
at his feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>The oil lamp was burning dimly, and the girl’s white
face was lost in the shadow, when the young man first
glanced at her, so he had no suspicion of the truth,
though a most undefinable sensation crept over him when
he heard the timid footfall, and the rustling of female garments
as <em>Adah Hastings</em> drew near with her boy in her
arms.</p>

<p class='c011'>He heard its faint breathings, and half turned his head
just as Adah passed on, her weary sigh falling distinctly
on his ear, but failing to awaken a feeling of remorse for
his unmanly conduct.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m glad she’s gone. I can’t be bothered,” was his
mental comment as he settled himself more comfortably,
feeling a glow of satisfaction when the train began to
move, and he knew no more women with their babies
would be likely to trouble him.</p>

<p class='c011'>With that first heavy strain of the machinery Adah
lost her balance, and would have fallen headlong but for
the friendly hand put forth to save the fall.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Take my seat, miss. It is not very convenient, but
it is better than none. I can find another.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the friendliest voice imaginable which said these
words to Adah, and the kind tone in which they were
uttered wrung the hot tears from her eyes. She did not
look up at him. She only knew that a gentleman had
risen and was bending over her; that a hand, was laid
upon her shoulder, putting her gently into the narrow
seat next the saloon; that the same hand took from her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>and hung above her head the little satchel which was so
much in her way, and that the manly voice, so sympathetic
in its tone, asked if she would be too warm, so
near the fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>She did not know there was a fire. She only knew
that she had found a friend, and with the delicious feeling
of safety which the knowledge brought, the tension
of her nerves gave way, and burying her head on Willie’s
face she wept for a moment silently. Then lifting it
up she tried to thank her benefactor, looking now at him
for the first time, and feeling half overawed to find him
so tall, so stylish, so exceedingly refined in every look and
action. Why had he cared for her? What was there
about her to win attention from such as he? Nothing;
his kindness was natural; it sprang from the great warm
heart, shining out from the eyes, seen beneath the <em>glasses</em>
which he wore!</p>

<p class='c011'>Irving Stanley was a passenger on that train, bound
for Albany. Like Dr. Richards, he had hoped to enjoy a
whole seat, even though it were not a very comfortable
one, but he would not resort to meanness for the sake of
his own ease; so when he saw how pale and tired Adah
was, he rose at once to offer his seat. He did not then
observe her face, or dress, or manner. He only saw she
was a delicate woman, travelling alone, and that was
enough to elicit his attention. He heard her sweet, low
voice as she tried to thank him, and felt intuitively that
she was neither coarse nor vulgar. He saw, too, the
little, soft, white hands, holding so fast to Willie. Was
he her brother or her son? She was young to be his
mother; but, there was no mistaking the mother-love
shining out from the brown eyes turned so quickly upon
the boy when he moaned, as if in pain, and seemed about
to waken.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He’s been sick most all the way,” she said, holding
him closer to her bosom. “There’s something the matter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>with his ear. Do children ever die with the ear-ache?”
and the eyes, swimming in tears, sought the face
of Irving Stanley as eagerly as if on his decision hung
little Willie’s life.</p>

<p class='c011'>Irving Stanley hardly thought they did. At all events
he never heard of such a case, and then, after suggesting
a remedy, should the pain return, he left his new acquaintance
and walked down the car in quest of another seat.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A part of your seat, sir, if you please,” and Irving’s
voice was rather authoritative than otherwise, as he
claimed the half of what the doctor was monopolizing.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was of no use for Dr. Richards to pretend he was
asleep, for Irving spoke so quietly, so like a man who
knew what he was doing, that the doctor was compelled
to yield, and turning about, recognized his Saratoga acquaintance.
The recognition was mutual, and after a
few natural remarks, Irving explained how he had given
his seat to a lady whose little child was suffering from
the ear-ache.</p>

<p class='c011'>“By the way, doctor,” he added, “you ought to know
the remedy for such ailments. Suppose you prescribe in
case it returns.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know but little about babies or their aches” the Dr.
answered, just as a scream of pain reached his ear, accompanied
by a suppressed effort on the mother’s part to
soothe her suffering child.</p>

<p class='c011'>Irving Stanley felt the sneer implied in the doctor’s
words, and it kept him silent for a time, while scream
after scream filled the car, and roused every sleeping occupant
to ask what was the matter. Some, and among them
the doctor, <em>cursed</em> the child thus disturbing their slumbers;
some wished it anything but complimentary wishes;
some felt and evinced real sympathy, while nearly all
glanced backward at the dark corner where the poor
mother sat bending over her infant, unmindful of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>many curious looks cast upon her. The pain must have
been intolerable, for the little fellow, in his agony, writhed
from Adah’s lap and sank upon the floor, his whole form
quivering with anguish as he cried, “Oh, ma! ma! ma
ma!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The hardest heart could scarce withstand that scene
and many now gathered near, offering advice and help
while even Dr. Richards experienced a most unaccountable
sensation as that baby cry smote on his ear. Foremost
among those who offered aid was Irving Stanley. His
was the voice which breathed comfort to the weeping
Adah, his the hand extended to take up little Willie, his
the arms which held and soothed the struggling boy, his
the mind which thought of everything available that could
possibly bring ease, until at last the outcries ceased and
Willie lay quietly in his arms.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll take him now,” and Adah put out her hands; but
Willie refused to go, and clung closer to Mr. Stanley, who
said, laughingly, “You see that I am preferred. He is
too heavy for you to hold. Please trust him to me,
awhile.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And Adah yielded to that voice, and leaning against
the window, rested her tired head upon her hand, while
Irving carried Willie to his seat beside the doctor.
There was a slight sneer on the doctor’s face as he saw the
little boy, but Irving Stanley he knew was not one whose
acts could be questioned by him; so he contented himself
with saying, “You must be fond of young ones.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fond of children,” Irving replied, laying great stress
on the word <em>children</em>. “Yes, I am, very; and even if I
were not, pity would prompt me to take this one from his
mother, who is so tired, besides being very pretty, and
that you knows goes far with us men.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You don’t like children, I reckon,” Irving continued,
as the doctor drew back from the little feet which unconsciously
touched his lap.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>“No, I hate them,” was the answer, spoken half savagely,
for at that moment a tiny hand was deliberately
laid on his, as Willie showed a disposition to be friendly.
“I hate them,” and the little hand was pushed rudely off.</p>

<p class='c011'>Wonderingly the soft, large eyes of the child looked up
to his. Something in their expression riveted the doctor’s
gaze as by a spell. There were tears in the baby’s eyes,
and the pretty lip began to quiver. The doctor’s finer
feelings, if he had any, were touched, and muttering to
himself, “I’m a brute,” he slouched his riding cap still
lower down upon his forehead, and turning away to the
window, relapsed into a gloomy reverie, in which thoughts
of <em>Lily</em> were strangely mingled with thoughts of the
dark-haired ’Lina, his bride elect, waiting for him in New
York. The Dr. was more than half tired of his engagement,
and ere returning to the city, he was going to Terrace
Hill to have a long talk with <em>Anna</em>, to tell her frankly
of his fears that ’Lina never could be congenial to them,
and perhaps he would tell her the <em>whole</em> of Lily’s story.</p>

<p class='c011'>But how should he commence a tale which would
shock his gentle sister so terribly? He did not know,
and while devising the best method, he forgot the two
little feet which in their bright-colored hose were
stretched out until they rested entirely upon his lap,
while the tiny face was nestled against Irving Stanley’s
fatherly bosom, where it lay for hours, until Adah, waking
from her refreshing slumber, came forward to relieve
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You had better not go on this morning. You ought
to rest,” Irving said to Adah, when at last the train
stopped in Albany. “I have a few moments to spare.
I will see that you are comfortable. You are going to
Snowdon, I think you said,” and taking Willie in his
arms he conducted Adah to the nearest hotel.</p>

<p class='c011'>There were but a few moments ere he must leave, and
standing by her side, he said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>“The meeting with you has been to me a pleasant incident,
and I shall not soon forget it. I trust we may
meet again. There is my card,” and he placed it in her
hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>At a glance Adah read the name, knowing now who
had befriended her. It was Irving Stanley, second cousin
to Hugh, and ’Lina was with his sister in New York.
He was going there, he might speak of her, and if she
told her name, her miserable story would be known to
more than it was already. It was a false pride which
kept Adah silent when she knew that Irving Stanley
was waiting for her to speak, and while she was struggling
to overcome it, Irving’s time expired and he must
go if he would not be left. Taking her hand he said
good-bye, while she tried again to thank him for his great
kindness to her; but she did not tell her name, and as
Irving would not ask it, he left her without the knowledge,
thinking of her often as he went his way to New
York, and wondering if they would ever meet again.</p>

<hr class='c014'>

<p class='c011'>In the office below, Dr. Richards, who had purposely
stopped for the day in Albany, smoked his expensive
cigars, ordered oysters and wine sent to his room—wrote
an explanatory note to ’Lina—feeling half tempted to
leave out the “Dear,” with which he felt constrained to
preface it—thought again of Lily—thought once of the
strange woman and the little boy, in whom Irving Stanley
had been so interested, wondered where they were
going, and who it was the boy looked a little like—thought
of <em>Anna</em> in connection with that boy; and then,
late in the afternoon, sauntered down to the Boston depot,
and took his seat in the car which, at about 10 o’clock
that night, would deposit him at Snowdon. There were
no children to disturb him, for Adah, unconscious of his
proximity, was in the rear car—weary, and nervous with
the dread which her near approach to Terrace Hill inspired.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>What if, after all, Anna should not want her? And
this was a possible contingency, notwithstanding Alice
had been so sanguine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can find employment somewhere—God will direct
me,” she whispered softly, drawing her veil over her tired
face, and thinking, she scarcely knew why, of Irving
Stanley.</p>

<p class='c011'>Darkly the December night closed in, and still the train
kept on, until at last Danville was reached, and she must
alight, as the express did not stop again until it reached
Worcester. With a chill sense of loneliness, and a vague,
confused wish for the one cheering voice which had greeted
her ear since leaving Spring Bank, Adah stood upon
the snow-covered platform, holding Willie in her arms,
and pointing out her trunk to the civil baggage man, who,
in answer to her inquiries as to the best means of reaching
Terrace Hill, replied, “You can’t go there to-night;
it is too late. You’ll have to stay in the tavern kept right
over the depot, though if you’d kept on the train there
might have been a chance, for I see the young Dr. Richards
aboard; and as he didn’t get out, I guess he’s coaxed
or hired the conductor to leave him at Snowdon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The baggage man was right in his conjecture, for the
doctor had persuaded the polite conductor, whom he knew
personally, to stop the train at Snowdon; and while Adah,
shivering with cold, found her way up the narrow stairs
into the rather comfortless quarters where she must spend
the night, the doctor was kicking the snow from his feet
and talking to Jim, the coachman from Terrace Hill.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXVII.<br> <span class='large'>ADAH AT TERRACE HILL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The next morning was cold and frosty, as winter mornings
in New England are wont to be, and Adah, shivered
involuntarily as from her uncurtained window she looked
out upon the bare woods and the frozen fields covered
with the snow of yesterday. Oh, how cold and dreary and
desolate everything seemed on that December morning; and
only Adah’s trust in Him who she knew would not forsake
her kept her heart from fainting. Even this could not keep
back her tears as she watched the coming of the eastern
train, and wished that she could take it and go back to
Spring Bank. Wistfully she watched the train which
paused for a single moment and then sped on its way, just
as there came a knock at the door, and the baggage man
appeared.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you please, ma’am,” he began, “the Terrace Hill
carriage is here—brung over the doctor, who has took
the train for New York. I told the driver how’t you
wanted to go there. Shall I give him your trunk?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Adah answered in the affirmative, and then hastened
to wrap up Willie. She was ready in a moment and
descended to the room where Jim, the driver, stood waiting
for her, eyeing her sharply, as if making up his mind
with regard to her position.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A lady,” was his mental comment, and with as much
politeness as if she had been Madam Richards herself, he
opened the carriage door and held Willie while she entered,
asking if she were comfortable, and peering a little
curiously in Willie’s face, which puzzled him somewhat.
“A near connection, I guess, and mighty pretty, too.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>I’m most sorry she’s come visiting just now, when old
madam and the others is so cross. Them old maids will
raise hob with the boy—nice little shaver,” thought the
kind hearted Jim, as he hurried up his horses, looking back
occasionally, and smiling at Willie, who had forgotten the
ache of yesterday, and was crowing with delight as the
carriage moved swiftly on.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once, as Adah caught his good-humored eye, she
ventured to say to him, “Has Miss Anna procured a waiting-maid yet?”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a comical gleam in Jim’s eye now, for Adah
was not the first applicant he had taken up to Terrace
Hill, and it was the memory of madam’s reception of them
which made him laugh. He never suspected that this was
Adah’s business, she was so unlike the others, and he
answered frankly, “No, that’s about played out. They don’t come as
thick as they did. Madam turned the last one out
doors.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Turned her out doors?” and Adah’s face was as white
as the snow rifts they were passing.</p>

<p class='c011'>The driver felt that he had gossiped too much, and
relapsed into silence, while Adah, in a paroxysm of terror
sat with clasped hands and closed eyes, unmindful of
Willie’s attempt to make her look at the huge building,
just in sight. In her dread of Mrs. Richards she scarcely
knew what she was doing, and leaning forward, at last she
said, huskily, “Driver, driver, do you think she’ll turn me off too?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Turn you off!” and in his surprise at the sudden suspicion
which for the first time darted across his mind, Jim
brought his horses to a full stop, while he held a parley
with the pale, frightened creature, asking so eagerly if
Mrs. Richards would turn her off. “Why should she?
You ain’t going there for that, be you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not to be turned out of doors, no,” Adah answered,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>“but I—I—I want that place so much. I read Miss
Anna’s advertisement; but please turn back, or let me
get out and walk. I can’t go there now. Is Miss Anna
like the rest?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jim had recovered himself a little, and though he could
not have been more astonished had Adah proved to be a
washerwoman, than he was to find her a waiting-maid, it
did not abate his respect for her one whit. She had been
a lady sure, and as such he should treat her. She had also
appealed to him for sympathy, and he would not withhold
it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Miss Anna’s an angel,” he answered. “If you get
her ear, you’re all right; the plague is to get it with them
two she cats ready to tear your eyes out. If I’se you, I’d
ask to see her. I wouldn’t tell my arrent either, till I did.
She’s sick up stairs; but I’ll see if Pamely can’t manage
it. That’s my woman—Pamely; been mine for four
years, and we’ve had two pair of twins, all dead; so I feel
tender towards the little ones,” and Jim glanced at Willie,
who had succeeded in making Adah notice the house
standing out so prominently against the winter sky, and
looking to the poor girl more like a prison than a home.</p>

<p class='c011'>Only one part of it seemed inviting—the two crimson-curtained
windows opening upon a verandah, from
which a flight of steps led down into what must be a
flower-garden.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Miss Anna’s room,” the driver said, pointing towards
it; and Adah looked out, vainly hoping for a glimpse of
the sweet face she had in her mind as Anna’s.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Anna was sick in bed with a headache, induced by
the excitement of her brother’s visit and the harsh words
which passed between him and his sisters, he telling them,
jokingly at first, that he was tired of getting married, and
half resolved to give it up; while they, in return, abused
him for fickleness, taunted him with their poverty, and
sharply reproached him for his unwillingness to lighten
their burden, by taking a rich wife when he could get one.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>All this John had repeated to Anna in the dim twilight
of the morning, as he stood by her bedside to bid her
good-bye; and she, as usual, had soothed him into quiet,
speaking kindly of his bride-elect, and saying she should
like her.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had not told her Lily’s story, as he meant to do.
There was no necessity for that, for the matter was fixed.
’Lina should be his wife, and he need not trouble Anna
further; so he had bidden her adieu, and was gone again,
the carriage which bore him away bringing back Adah and
her boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jim opened the wide door for her, and ushered her into
a little reception room, where the Misses Richards received
their morning calls. Drawing a deep arm chair to
the fire, Adah sat down before the cheerful blaze, and
looked around her with that strange feeling one experiences
where everything is new.</p>

<p class='c011'>Willie seemed perfectly at home, seating himself upon
a little stool, covered with some of Miss Eudora’s choicest
worsted embroidery, a piece of work of which she was
very proud, never allowing anything to touch it lest the
roses should be jammed, or the raised leaves defaced.
But Willie cared neither for leaves not roses, nor yet for
Miss Eudora, and drawing the stool to his mother’s side,
he sat kicking his little heels into a worn place of the
carpet, which no child had kicked since the doctor’s days
of babyhood. The tender threads were fast giving way
to the vigorous strokes, when two doors opposite each
other opened simultaneously, and both Mrs. Richards and
Eudora appeared.</p>

<p class='c011'>They had heard from Jim that a stranger was there,
and as all the cross questionings concerning Adah elicited
only the assertion, that “she <em>was</em> a lady,” both had
made a slight change in their toilet ere starting for the
room which they reached together, Mrs. Richards taking
in at once the fit and material of Adah’s traveling dress,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>deciding that the collar, unbuttoned and shoved back from
the throat, was real mink, as were the wristlets on which
a pair of small white hands were folded together. She
noticed, too, the tiny linen cuffs, with the neat gold buttons
which Alice had made Adah wear. Everything was
in keeping, and their visitor was a lady. This was her
decision, while Eudora noticed only Willie on the bouquet
which had cost her so much labor, and the alarming size
of that worn spot in the carpet where the little high
heeled slipper still was busy. Her first impulse was to
seize him by the arm and transfer him to some other locality,
but the beauty of his face diverted her attention,
and she involuntarily drew a step nearer to the child, fascinated
by him, just as her mother was attracted towards
Adah.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you—ah, yes—you are the lady who Jim said
wished to see me,” the latter began, bowing politely to
Adah, who had not yet dared to look up, and who when
at last she did raise her eyes, withdrew them at once,
more abashed, more frightened, more bewildered than ever,
for the face she saw fully warranted her ideas of a
woman who could turn a waiting-maid from her door just
because she was a waiting-maid.</p>

<p class='c011'>Something seemed choking Adah and preventing her
utterance, for she did not speak until Mrs. Richards said
again, this time with a little less suavity and a little more
hauteur of manner, “Have I had the honor of meeting
you before?”—then with a low gasp, a mental petition
for help, Adah rose up and lifting to Mrs. Richards’ cold,
haughty face, her soft, brown eyes, where tears were almost
visible, answered faintly, “We have not met before.
Excuse me, madam, but my business is with Miss Anna,
can I see her please?”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was something supplicating in the tone with
which Adah made this request, and it struck Mrs. Richards
unpleasantly, making her answer haughtily, “My
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>daughter is sick. She does not see visitors, but I will
take your name and your errand.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Too much confused to remember anything distinctly
Adah forgot Jim’s injunction; forgot that Pamelia was to
arrange it somehow; forgot everything, except that Mrs.
Richards was waiting for her to speak. An ominous
cough from Eudora decided her, and then her reason for
being there came out. She had seen Miss Anna’s advertisement,
she wanted a place, and she had come so far to
get it; had left a happy home that she might not be
dependent but earn her bread for herself and her little
boy. Would they take her message to Anna? Would
they let her stay? and Adah’s voice took a tone of wild
entreaty as she marked the lowering of madam’s brow,
and the perceptible change in her manner when she ascertained
that, according to her creed, not a lady but a
menial stood before her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You say you left a happy home,” and the thin, sneering
lips of Eudora were pressed so tightly together that the
words could scarcely find egress. “May I ask, if it was so
happy, why you left it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a flush on Adah’s cheek as she replied, “Because
it was a home granted at first from charity. It was
not mine. The people were poor, and I would not longer
be a burden to them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And your husband—where is he?”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was the hardest question of all, and Adah’s distress
was visible as she replied. “Willie’s father left me, and I
don’t know where he is.”</p>

<p class='c011'>An incredulous, provoking smile flitted over Eudora’s
face as she returned, “We hardly care to have a deserted
wife in our family—it might be unpleasant.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” and the old lady took up the argument, “Anna
is well enough without a maid. I don’t know why she
put that foolish advertisement in the paper, in answer, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>believe, to one equally foolish which she saw about an
unfortunate woman with a child.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am that woman. I wrote that advertisement when
my heart was heavier than it is now, and God took care of
it. He pointed it out to Miss Anna. He caused her to
answer it. He sent me here, and you will let me see her.
Think if it were your own daughter, pleading thus with
some one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is impossible. Neither my daughter, nor my
daughter-in-law, if I had one, could ever come to a servant’s
position,” Mrs. Richards replied, not harshly, for
there was something in Adah’s manner which rode down
her resentful pride; and she might have yielded, but for
Eudora, whose hands had so ached to shake the little child,
now innocently picking at a bud.</p>

<p class='c011'>How she did long to box his ears, and while her mother
talked, she had taken a step forward more than once, but
stopped as often, held in check by the little face and soft
blue eyes turned so trustingly upon her, the pretty lips
once actually putting themselves toward her, as if expecting
a kiss. Eudora could not harm that child sitting on her
embroidery as coolly as if he had a right: but she could
prevent her mother from granting the stranger’s request;
so when she saw signs of yielding, she said, decidedly,
“She cannot see Anna, mother. You know how foolish
she is, and there’s no telling what fancy she might take.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Eudora,” said Mrs. Richards in a low tone, “it might
be well for Anna to have a maid, and this one is certainly
different from the others who have applied.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But we can’t be bothered with a child. It would
drive us crazy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, certainly, I did not think of that. A child would
be very troublesome,” Mrs. Richards rejoined.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So madam, you see how impossible it is for us to keep
you, but you can of course stay till car-time, when Jim
will carry you back to the depot.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>She said this so decidedly that all hope died out of
Adah’s heart and she felt as if she were going to faint with
the crushing disappointment.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just then the door bell rang. It was the doctor, come
to visit Anna, and both Mrs. Richards and Eudora left
the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, why did I come here, and where shall I go?”
Adah moaned, as a sense of her lonely condition came
over her.</p>

<p class='c011'>She knew she would be welcome in Kentucky, but Hugh
could not afford to have her back, and she had so counted
on helping him with her first wages.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will my Father in Heaven direct me? will he tell me
what to do?” she murmured brokenly, praying softly to
herself that a way might be opened for her, a path which
she could tread. She could not help herself. All her dependence
now was in her God, and in trusting him she
found rest at last.</p>

<p class='c011'>She could not tell how it was, but a quiet peace stole
over her, a feeling which had no thought or care for the
future, and it had been many nights since she had slept as
sweetly or soundly as she did for one-half hour with her
head upon the table in that little room at Terrace Hill,
Dr. Richard’s home and Anna’s. She did not see the
good-humored face which looked in at her a moment, nor
hear the whispering in the hall; neither did she know
when Willie was coaxed from the room and carried up
the stairs into the upper hall, where he was purposely left
to himself, while Pamelia went to Anna’s room, where
she was to sit for an hour or so, while the ladies had their
lunch. Anna’s head was better; the paroxysms of pain
were less frequent than in the morning, and she lay upon
her pillow, so nearly asleep that she did not hear that
unusual sound for Terrace Hill, the patter of little feet in
the hall without. Tired of staying by himself and spying
the open door, Willie hastened toward it, pausing a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>moment on the threshold as if to reconnoiter. Something
in Anna’s attitude, as she lay with her long fair hair falling
over the pillow, must have reminded him of Alice, for
with a cry of delight, he ran forward, and patting the
white cheek with his soft baby hand, lisped out the word
“Arn-tee, Arn-tee,” making Anna start suddenly and gaze
at him in wondering surprise.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who is he?” she said, drawing him to her at once
and pressing a kiss upon his rosy face.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pamelia told her what she knew of the stranger waiting
in the reception room, adding in conclusion, “I believe
they said you did not want her, and Jim is to take her to
the depot when it’s time. She’s very young and pretty,
and looks so sorry, Jim told me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Said I did not want her! How did they know?” and
something of the Richards’ spirit flashed from Anna’s
eyes. “The child is so beautiful, and he called me, <em>Auntie</em>,
too! He must have an auntie somewhere. Little dear!
how she must love him! Lift him up, Pamelia!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The woman obeyed, and Willie was soon nestled close
to Anna, who kissed him again, smoothed his curls, pinched
his cheek, squeezed his soft hands, and then asked
whom he so much resembled.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pamelia could not tell. The likeness had puzzled her,
but she never thought of finding it in her young mistress’
face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must see his mother,” Anna said, as she continued
to caress and fondle him. “Perhaps I should like her. At
any events I will hear what she has to say. Show her up,
Pamelia; but first smooth my hair a little and arrange
my pillows,” she added, feeling intuitively that the stranger
was not like the others who had come to her on similar
errands.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pamelia complied with her request, brushing back the
long, loose locks, and making the bed more smooth and
tidy in its appearance; then leaving Willie with Anna,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>she repaired to the reception room, and rousing the sleeping
Adah, said to her hurriedly,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Please, miss, come quick; Miss Anna wants to see
you. The little boy is up there with her.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br> <span class='large'>ANNA AND ADAH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>For a moment Anna was inclined to think that Pamelia
had made a mistake and brought her the wrong individual,
but Willie set her right by patting her cheek again, while
he called out, “Mamma, arntee.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The look of interest which Anna cast upon him emboldened
Adah to say,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Excuse him, Miss Richards; he must have mistaken
you for a dear friend at home, whom he calls <em>Auntie</em>. I’ll
take him down; he troubles you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, no, please not,” and Anna passed her arm around
him. “I love children so much. I ought to have been a
wife and mother, my brother says, instead of a useless old
maid.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Adah was too much a stranger to disclaim against Anna’s
calling herself old, so she paid no attention to the remark,
but plunged at once into the matter which had
brought her there. Presuming they would rather be alone,
Pamelia had purposely left the room, meeting in the lower
hall with lady Richards, who, in much affright, was
searching for the recent occupants of the reception room.
She had ordered Dixson to carry them some lunch, and
Dixson had returned with the news that there was no
woman or child to be seen. Where were they then?
Had they decamped, taking with them anything valuable
which chanced to be in their way? Of course they had,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>and Eudora in the parlor, and Asenath in the dining room,
and Mrs. Richards in the hall, were hunting for missing
articles, when Pamelia quieted them by saying, “The lady
was in Miss Anna’s room.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At any other time Mrs. Richards would have corrected
her domestic for calling a servant a lady, but she did not
mind it now in her surprise.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How came she there?” she said, angrily, while Pamelia
replied, evasively,</p>

<p class='c011'>“The little boy got up stairs, and, as children will,
walked right into Miss Anna’s room. She was taken
with him at once, and asked who he was. I told her and
she sent for the lady. That’s how it happened.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It could not now be helped, and Mrs. Richards hurried
up to Anna’s chamber, where Willie still was perched by
Anna’s pillow, playing with the rings upon her fingers,
while Adah, with her bonnet in her lap, sat a little apart,
traces of tears and agitation upon her cheeks, but a look
of happiness in the eyes fixed so wistfully on Anna’s fair,
sweet face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Please, mother,” said Anna, motioning her away, “leave
us alone awhile. Shut the door, and see that no one comes
near.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Richards obeyed, and Anna, waiting until she was
out of hearing, resumed the conversation just where it had
been interrupted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And so you are the one who wrote that advertisement
which I read. Let me see—the very night my brother
came home from Europe. I remember he laughed because
I was so interested, and he accidentally tore off the name
to light his cigar so I forgot it entirely. What shall I call
you, please?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Adah was silent a moment and then she answered,
“Adah, Adah Hastings, but please do not ask <em>where</em> I
came from now. I will tell you of the past, though I did
not even mean to do that, but something about you makes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>me know I can trust you.” And then, amid a shower of
tears, in which Anna’s, too, were mingled, Adah told her
sad story—told of the mock marriage, the cruel desertion,
of Willie’s birth, her utter wretchedness, her attempt at
suicide, her final trust in God, her going at last to one who
gave her a home, even when he could not afford it; of her
accidentally finding Anna’s advertisement, and its result.
No names were given, not even that of New York. It
was merely the city and the country, and forgetful of the
medium through which she first heard of Adah, Anna
fancied Boston to have been the scene of her trials.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But why do you wish to conceal your recent home?”
she asked, after Adah had finished. “Is there any reason?”</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment Adah was tempted to tell the whole, but
when she remembered how on the day of her departure
from Spring Bank Mrs. Worthington had asked her not
to say any thing disparaging of ’Lina, and admitted that
it would be a great relief if the Richards family should not
know for the present at least that she came from Spring
Bank, she replied,</p>

<p class='c011'>“At first there was none in particular, save a fancy I
had, but there came one afterwards—the request of one
who had been kind to me as a dear mother. Is it wrong
not to tell the whole?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think not. You have dealt honestly with me so far,
and I am sure I can trust you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She meant to keep her then. She was not going to
send her away, and Adah’s face lighted up with a joy
which made it so beautiful that Anna gazed at her in
surprise, marveling that any heart could be so hard as to
desert that gentle girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, may I stay?” Adah asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course you may. Did you think I would turn you
away?” was Anna’s reply; and laying her head upon the
white counterpane of the bed, Adah cried passionately;
not a wild, bitter cry, but a delicious kind of cry which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>did her good, even though her whole frame quivered and
her low, choking sobs fell distinctly on Anna’s ear.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor child!” the latter said, laying her soft hand on
the bowed head. “You have suffered much, but with me
you shall find rest. I want you for a companion, rather
than a maid. You are better suited for it, and we shall
be very happy together, I am sure, though I am so much
an invalid. I, too, have had my heart trouble; not like
yours, but heavy enough to make me wish I could die.
I was young and wayward then. I had not learned
patience where alone it is to be found.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was seldom that Anna alluded to herself in this way,
and to do so to a stranger was utterly foreign to the
Richards’ nature. But Anna could not help it. There
was something about Adah which interested her greatly.
She knew she was above a waiting-maid’s position, that
in point of refinement and cultivation she was fully equal
to herself; and when she decided to keep her, it was with
the determination that she should be made to feel the
degradation of her position as little as possible. She
could not wholly shield her from her mother’s and sisters’
pride, but she would do what she could, and perhaps
some day the recreant lover would be found and brought
back to a sense of his duty.</p>

<p class='c011'>Blessed Anna Richards,—the world has few like her,
so gentle, so kind, so lovely, and as no one could long be
with her and not feel her influence, so Adah grew calm,
at last, and at Anna’s request laid aside her cloak and hat
in which she had been sitting.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Touch that bell, if you please, and ring Pamelia up,”
Anna said. “There’s a little room adjoining this, opening
into the hall, and also in here—that’s the door, with the
bureau against it. I mean to give you that. You will be
so near me, and so retired, too, when you like. John—that’s
my brother—occupied it when a boy, but as he
grew larger he said it was too small. Still, I think it will
answer nicely for you.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>Obedient to the ring, Pamelia came, manifesting no surprise
when told by Anna to move the dressing bureau
back to the corner where it used to stand, to unlock the
door and see if the little room was in order. “I know it
is,” she said, “I put it so this morning. There’s a fire, too.
Miss Anna has forgot that Dr. John slept here last night,
because it did not take so long to warm up as his big
chamber.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do remember now,” Anna replied. “Mrs. Hastings
can go in at once. She must be tired; and, Pamelia, send
lunch to her room, and tell your husband to bring up her
trunk.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Again Pamelia bowed and departed to do her young
mistress’ bidding, while Adah entered the pleasant room
where Dr. Richards had slept the previous night, leaving
behind him, as he always did, an odor of cigars. Adah
detected the perfume, but it was not disagreeable—on
the contrary, it reminded her of George, and for a brief
moment there stole over her a feeling as if in some way
she were brought very near to him by being in Dr. Richards’
room! What a cosy place it was, and how she
wished the people at Spring Bank could know all about
it. How thankful they would be, and how thankful she
was for this resting place in the protection of sweet Anna
Richards. It was better than she had ever dared to hope
for, and sinking down by the snowy-covered bed, she
murmured inaudibly the prayer of thanksgiving to Him
who had led her to Terrace Hill.</p>

<p class='c011'>There were dark frowns on the faces of the mother and
elder sisters when they learned of Anna’s decision with
regard to Adah, but Anna’s income, received from the
Aunt for whom she was named, gave her a right to act as
she pleased, so they contented themselves with a few ill
natured remarks concerning her foolishness, and the <em>airs</em>
the waiting-maid put on. Adah, or Hastings as they called
her, was not their idea of a waiting-maid, and they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>watched her curiously whenever she came in their sight,
wondering at her cultivated manners and how Anna would
ever manage one apparently so much her equal. Anna
wondered so too, for it was an awkward business, requiring
a menial’s service of that lady-like creature, with language
so pure and manner so refined, and she would have
been exceedingly perplexed had not Adah’s good sense
come to the rescue, prompting her to do things unasked,
and to do them in such a way that Anna was at once relieved
from all embarrassment, and felt that she had found
a treasure indeed. She did not join the family in the evening,
but kept her room instead, talking with Adah, and
caressing and playing with little Willie, who persisted in
calling her “Arn-tee,” in spite of all Adah could say.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never mind,” Anna answered, laughingly; “I rather
like to hear him. No one has ever called me by that
name, and maybe never will, though my brother is engaged
to be married in the spring. I have a picture of his betrothed
there on my bureau. Would you like to see
it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Adah nodded, and was soon gazing on the dark, haughty
face she knew so well, and which even from the casing,
seemed to smile disdainfully, upon her, just as the original
had often done. There was Ellen Tiffton’s bracelet upon
the rounded arm, Ellen’s chain upon the bare neck,
while twined among the braids of her hair was something
which looked like a bandeau of pearls, and which had
been borrowed for the occasion of Mrs. Ellsworth, Irving’s
sister.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do you think of her?” Anna asked, wondering
a little at the expression of Adah’s face.</p>

<p class='c011'>Adah must say something, and she replied,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I dare say people think her pretty.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; but what do you think? I asked your opinion,”
persisted Anna, and thus beset Adah replied at last,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think her too showily dressed for a picture. She displays
too much jewelry.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>Feeling a little piqued that a stranger should have seized
upon the very point which had seriously annoyed herself,
Anna began to defend her future sister, never dreaming
how much more than herself Adah knew of ’Lina Worthington.</p>

<p class='c011'>It seemed to Adah like a miserable deceit, sitting there
and listening while Anna talked of ’Lina, and she was
glad when at last she showed signs of weariness, and expressed
a desire to retire for the night.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Would you mind reading to me from the Bible?”
Anna asked, as Adah was about to leave her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no, I’d like it so much,” and bringing her own
little Bible to Anna’s bedside, Adah read her favorite
chapter, the one which had comforted her so often when
life was at its darkest.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Anna, listening to the sweet, silvery tones reading,
“Let not your heart be troubled,” felt her own sorrow
grow less, while there went silently up a prayer of thanksgiving
to heaven who had sent her such a comfort as Adah
Hastings.</p>

<p class='c011'>The chapter was ended, the little Testament closed, and
then for a moment Adah sat as if waiting for Anna to
speak. But Anna continued silent, her thoughts intent
upon those mansions her elder brother had gone home before
her to prepare.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you please,” Adah said timidly, bending over the
sweet face resting on the pillow, “if you please, may I
say the Lord’s Prayer here with you? I shall sleep better
for it. I used to say it with——”</p>

<p class='c011'>She stopped suddenly ere the loved name of <em>Alice</em> had
passed her lips, but Anna was kindly unconscious of the
almost mistake, and only answered by grasping Adah’s
hand, and whispering to her,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, say it, do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Adah knelt beside her, and Anna’s fair hand rested,
as if in blessing, on her head, as they said together,
“Our Father.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>It was a lovely sight, those two girls as it were, the
one mistress, the other the maid, yet both forgetting the
inequality in that expression of a common faith which
made them truly equals; and Eudora, awed at the sight
paused a moment on the threshold, and then moved silently
away, lest they should know she had been there.</p>

<p class='c011'>At first Adah’s position at Terrace Hill was a very trying
one, but Anna’s unfailing kindness and thoughtfulness
shielded her from much that was unpleasant, while the
fact that Willie was finding favor in the eyes of those who
had considered him an intruder, helped to make her burden
easy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Accustomed to the free range of Spring Bank, Willie
asserted the same right at Terrace Hill, going where he
pleased, and putting himself so often in Mrs. Richards
way, that she began at last to notice him, and if no one
was near, to caress the handsome boy. Asenath and Eudora
held out longer, but even they were not proof against
Willie’s winning ways. His innocent prattle, and the
patter of his little feet, heard from day dawn till night,
thawed the ice from their hearts, until Asenath, the softer
of the two, was once caught by Adah in the very undignified
act of playing she was coach horse, while Willie’s
whip, given to him by Anna, was snapped in close
proximity to her ears; Eudora, too, no longer hid her
worsted stool, and as the weeks went on, there gradually
came to be prints of little, soiled, dirty fingers—on
the sideboard in the dining room, on the hat-stand in
the hall, on the table in the parlor, and even on the
dressing bureau in Madame’s bed chamber, where the
busy, active child had forced an entrance.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was some weeks ere Adah wrote to Alice Johnson,
and when at last she did, she said of Terrace Hill,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am happier here than I at first supposed it possible.
The older ladies were so proud, that it made me very
wretched, in spite of sweet Anna’s kindness. But there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>has come a perceptible change, and they now treat me
civilly, if nothing more, while I do believe they are fond
of Willie, and would miss him if he were gone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Adah was right in this conjecture; for had it now been
optional with the Misses Richards whether Willie should
go or stay, they would have kept him there from choice
so cheery and pleasant he made the house. Adah was
still too pretty, too stylish, to suit their ideas of a servant;
but when they found she did not presume at
all on her good looks, but meekly kept her place, they
dropped the haughty manner they had at first assumed,
and treated her with civility if not with kindness.</p>

<p class='c011'>With Anna it was different. Won by Adah’s gentleness,
and purity, she came at last to love her almost as
much as if she had been a younger sister. Adah was
not a servant to her, but a companion, a friend, with
whom she daily held familiar converse, learning from her
much that was good, and prizing her more and more as
the winter weeks went swiftly by.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had also grown very confidential, telling Adah
much of her past life, talking freely of Charlie Millbrook
whose wife she had heard was dead, and for whose return
to America she was hoping. She was talking of him one
afternoon and blushing like a girl as Adah playfully suggested
what might possibly ensue from his coming home,
when her mother came in evidently annoyed and disturbed
at something.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have a letter from John,” she said. “They are to be
married the —— day of April, which leaves us only five
weeks more, as they will start at once for Terrace Hill.
I am so bothered. I want to see you alone,” and she
cast a furtive glance at Adah, who left the room, while
madam plunged at once into the matter agitating her so
much.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had fully intended going to Kentucky with her
son. It would be a good opportunity for seeing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>country, besides showing proper respect to her daughter-in-law,
but ’Lina had objected, not in words, but in manner,
objected, and the doctor had written, saying she
must not go, at the same time urging upon her the necessity
of having everything in perfect order, and in as
good style as possible for his bride.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have not the money myself,” he wrote, “and I’ll
have to get trusted for my wedding suit, so you must
appeal to Anna’s good nature for the wherewithal with
which to fix the rooms. It’s downright mean, I know,
but she’s the only one of the firm who has money. Do,
pray, re-paper them; that chocolate color is enough to
give one the blues; and get a carpet too, something lively
and cheerful. She may stay with you longer than you
anticipate. It is too expensive living here as she would
expect to live. Nothing but Fifth Avenue Hotel would
suit her, and I cannot ask her for funds at once. I’d rather
come to it gradually.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And this it was which so disturbed Mrs. Richards’
peace of mind. She could not go to Kentucky, and she
might as well have saved the money she had expended
in getting her black silk velvet dress fixed for the occasion,
while worst of all she must have John’s wife there for
months, perhaps, whether she liked it or not, and she must
also fit up the rooms with paper and paint and carpets,
notwithstanding that she’d nothing to do it with, unless
Anna generously gave the necessary sum from her own
yearly income. This Anna promised to do, suggesting
that Adah should make the carpet, as that would save a
little.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish, mother,” she added, “that you would let her
arrange the rooms altogether. She has exquisite taste,
besides the faculty of making the most of things.” Mrs.
Richards, too, had confidence in Adah’s taste, and so it
was finally arranged that Adah should superintend the
bridal rooms, subject of course to the dictation of Madame
and her daughters.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>At first Eudora and Asenath demurred, but when they
saw how competent Adah was, and how modest withal in
giving her opinions, they yielded the point, so far as actual
overseeing was concerned, contenting themselves with
suggestions which Adah followed or not just as she
liked.</p>

<p class='c011'>Frequently doubts crossed her mind as to the future
when it might be known that <em>she</em> came from Spring Bank,
and knew the expected bride. Would she not be blamed
as a party in the deception? Did God think it right for
her to keep silent concerning the past? Ought she not
to tell Anna frankly that she knew her brother’s betrothed?
She did not know, and the harassing anxiety wore
upon her faster than all the work she had to do.</p>

<hr class='c014'>

<p class='c011'>The Dr. was expected home for a day before starting
for Kentucky, and Adah frequently caught herself wondering
if she should see him. She presumed she should
not unless it were by accident, neither did she care particularly
if she did not, and so on the morning of his expected
arrival, when the other members of the household
were anxious and watchful, she alone was quiet and self-possessed,
doing her duties as usual, and feeling no presentiment
of the shock awaiting her. She was in the dining
room when the door bell rang, and she heard the tramp of
horses’ feet as Jim drove round to the stable. The doctor
had come and she must go, but where was Willie? He
was with her a moment ago, but she could not see him
now. She hoped he was not in the parlor, for she knew
it would annoy Eudora, who had more than once said
something in her hearing about that “child forever under
foot.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Willie, Willie,” she called, in a tremor of distress, as
she heard his little feet pattering through the hall, together
with the rush of other feet as madame, Asenath and
Eudora, all came down together to admit their son and
brother.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>But Willie paid no heed, and as Eudora had said, was
directly under foot, when she unlocked the door; his
the first form distinctly seen, his the first face which met
the doctor’s view, and his fearless baby laugh the first
sound which welcomed the doctor home!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXIX.<br> <span class='large'>THE RESULT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>It was not a disagreeable picture—that chubby,
rosy cheeked little boy, his white fat shoulders peeping
out from the dress of crimson and black, his fair curls
blowing around his forehead, and his eyes raised curiously
to the doctor’s face. Willie had not expected to see a
stranger, and at sight of the tall figure, muffled above the
chin, he drew back timidly and half hid himself behind
Mrs. Richards, whom he intuitively knew to be the warmest
ally he had among the three ladies gathered in the hall.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the doctor had said to Irving Stanley he disliked
children, but he could not help noticing Willie, and after
the first greetings were over he asked, “Whom have we
here? whose child is this?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Eudora and Asenath tried to frown, but the expression
of their faces softened as they glanced at Willie, who had
followed them into the parlor, and who, with one little
foot thrown forward, and his fat hands pressed together,
stood upon the hearth rug, gazing at the doctor with that
strange look which had so often puzzled, bewildered, and
fascinated the entire Richards family.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Anna wrote you that the maid she so much wanted
had come to her at last—a very lady-like person, who
has evidently seen better days, and this is her boy, Willie.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>He is such a queer little fellow, that we allow him more
liberties than we ought.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was Mrs. Richards who volunteered this explanation,
while her son stood looking down at Willie, wondering
what it was about the child which seemed familiar.
Anna had mentioned Mrs. Hastings in her letter—had
said how much she liked her, had spoken of her boy, but
the <em>Hastings</em> had been badly blotted, and as the Doctor
was too much absorbed in his own affairs to care for Anna’s
waiting-maid, he had not thought of her since, notwithstanding
that ’Lina had tried many times to make
him speak of Anna’s maid, so as to calculate her own safety.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So you’ve taken to petting a servant’s child, for want
of something better,” he said in answer to Mrs. Richards’
rather long speech concerning Willie.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ere Mrs. Richards could reply Anna made her appearance,
and the fastidious Doctor forgot the little fellow,
who was coaxed from the room by Pamelia, and taken to
his mother.</p>

<p class='c011'>The doctor was not in as good humor as men are supposed
to be on the eve of their marriage with heiresses.
He had offered to accompany ’Lina to Kentucky, but she
had peremptorily declined his escort, and rather, as it seemed
to him, thrust herself upon a gentleman and lady who
were returning to Louisville. Several little things which
she had done at the last had displeased him, as showing
less refinement than he had given her credit for possessing,
besides which he could not conceal from himself the
suspicion that Mrs. Ellsworth was heartily glad to be rid of
her, and had perhaps talked of going to Europe with her little
girl as a ruse, and that she was not a favorite with
any one of his particular friends. Still he meant to marry
her, and after the late dinner was over he went with
Anna to inspect the rooms which Adah had fitted for his
bride. They were very pleasant, and he could find fault
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>with nothing. The carpet, the curtains, the new light
furniture, the arm chair by the window where ’Lina was
expected to sit, the fanciful work basket standing near,
and his chair not far away, all were in perfect taste, but
still there was a load upon his heart, making him so silent
and moody, that Anna forebore talking to him much and
did not even mention <em>Adah</em>, though she had meant to tell
him just what a treasure she was and perhaps have him
see her too. But the doctor was in no frame of mind to
talk of strangers, for thoughts of Lily were particularly
haunting him to-day.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a great mistake he made when he cast her off
but it could not now be helped. No tears, no regrets
could bring back the dear little form laid away beneath
the grassy sod, and so he would not waste his time in idle
mourning. He would do the best he could with ’Lina.
He did believe she loved him. He was almost sure of it,
and as a means of redressing Lily’s wrongs he would be
kind to her. Lily would bid him do so if she could
speak. She surely knew what he was doing; perhaps
she was very near to him; he somehow felt that she was,
and more than once, he caught himself turning suddenly
with the fancy that Lily was behind him. The doctor
was not superstitious, but he began at last to feel that it
would be a relief to be freed from the Lily-laden atmosphere
pervading Terrace Hill, and rather joyfully he
watched the sun as it passed the meridian, and sank
lower and lower in the west, for by that token he knew
he had not a much longer time to stay at home, as he
would take the evening train bound for Albany.</p>

<hr class='c014'>

<p class='c011'>Slowly the twilight shadows crept over Terrace Hill
and into the little room where Adah was preparing for
her accustomed walk to the office. Willie was down
with Pamelia, who, when she came up for him, had told
Adah as something of which she should be proud, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>the doctor had actually thrown Willie into the air and
pronounced him a splendid-looking child, “considering.”</p>

<p class='c011'>That “considering” wounded Adah, for she felt the
sneer at her position which it implied, and with a faint
smile, she dismissed Pamelia, and then went to the
closet for the over-shoes she would need in her damp
walk. But what was it which fell like a thunderbolt on
her ear, riveting her to the spot where she stood, rigid
and immovable. Between the closet and Anna’s room
there was only a thin partition, and when the door was
open every sound was distinctly heard. The doctor had
just come in, and it was his voice, heard for the first time,
which sent the blood throbbing so madly through Adah’s
veins, and made the sparks of fire dance before her eyes.
She was not deceived—the tones were too distinct, too full,
too well remembered to be mistaken, and stretching out her
hands in the dim darkness, she moaned faintly: “George!
’tis George!” then sank upon the floor, powerless but
not fainting, nor yet unconscious of the terrible certainty
that <em>George</em> was so near to her that but for the partition
she might almost have touched him! She could hear
him now saying to Anna, “Are we alone? I wish to
speak my farewell words in private.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, all alone,” Anna replied. “Mrs. Hastings has
gone to the Post-office. Was it any thing particular you
wished to tell me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Doctor either did not hear the name “Mrs. Hastings,”
or did not notice it, and again the familiar tones
thrilled on Adah’s ear as he replied, “Nothing very particular.
I only wished to say a few words of ’Lina. I
want you to like her, to make up, if possible, for the love
I ought to give her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ought to give her! Oh, brother, are you taking
’Lina without love? Better never make the vow than
break it after it is made.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna spoke earnestly, and the doctor, who always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>tried to retain her good opinion, replied evasively, “I
suppose I do love her as well as half the world love
their wives before marriage, but she is different from any
ladies I have known; so different from, what poor Lily was.
Anna, let me talk with you again of Lily. I never told
you all—but what <em>is</em> that?” he continued, as he indistinctly
heard the choking, gasping, stifled sob, which
Adah gave at the sound of the dear pet name, which
used to make the blood thrill so ecstatically through her
veins, and which now, for a single moment, made her
heart bound with sudden joy; but only for a moment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor Lily,” said a hundred times, with a hundred fold
more tenderness than he was wont to say it, could not
atone for the past; for the cruel desertion, for the deception
even of the <em>name</em>; and so the poor, wounded heart
grew still again as lead, while Anna answered, “It’s only
the rising wind. It sounds so always when it’s in the
east. What of Lily? Do you wish you were going
after her instead of ’Lina?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Could Anna have seen then into the darkness of the
adjoining room, she would have shrunk in terror from the
figure, which, as she asked <em>that</em> question, struggled to its
knees, and creeping nearer to the door, turned its white,
spectral face toward her, listening eagerly for the answer.
Oh, why did the doctor hesitate a moment? Why did
he suffer his dread of losing Anna’s respect to triumph
over every other feeling? He had meant to tell her all,
how he did love the gentle girl, who confided herself to
him—how he loved even her memory now far more
than he loved ’Lina, but something kept the full confession
back, and he answered,</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>I don’t know.</em> We must have money, and ’Lina is
rich, while Lily was very poor, and the only friend or relation
she knew was one with whom I would not dare
have you come in contact, he was so wicked and reckless.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>This was what the doctor said, and into the brown
eyes, now bloodshot and dim with anguish, there came
the hard, fierce look, before which Alice Johnson once
had shuddered, when Adah Hastings said,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should hate him!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And in that dark hour of agony Adah felt that she did
hate him. She knew now that what she before would
not believe was true. He had not made her a lawful
wife, else he had never dared to take another. She was
a degraded creature, Willie a child of sin, and he had
made them so. It was the bitterest dreg she had been
forced to take, and for an instant, she forgot the God she
served, forgot every thing save the desire to curse the
man talking so calmly of her, as if her ruin were nought
to him. But anon, the still small voice she always obeyed
spoke to her tumultuous spirit, and the curse on her
lips died away in the faint whisper, “Forgive me, Father,
and forgive him, too.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She did not hear him now, for with that prayer, all consciousness
forsook her, and she lay on her face insensible,
while at the very last he did confess to Anna that <em>Lily
was his wife</em>. He did not say unlawfully so. He could
not tell her that. He said,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I married her privately. I kept it from you all until
she died. I would bring her back if I could, but I cannot,
and I shall marry ’Lina.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But,” and Anna grasped his hand nervously, “I
thought you told me once, that you won her love, and
then, when mother’s harsh letters came, left her without
a word. Was that story false?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The doctor was wading out in deep waters, and in
desperation he added lie to lie, saying, huskily—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, that was false. I tell you I married her, and she
died. Was I to blame for that?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, no, oh, no. I’d far rather it were so. I respect
you more than if you had left her. I am glad, so glad not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>that she died, but that you are not so bad as I feared.
Sweet Lily,” and Anna’s tears flowed fast to the memory
of the poor girl whose early grave she saw in fancy some
where in a beautiful Greenwood.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a knock at the door, and Jim appeared, inquiring
if the doctor would have the carriage brought
round. It was nearly time to go, and with the whispered
words to Anna, “I have told you what no one else
must ever know,” the doctor descended with his sister to
the parlor, where his mother was waiting for him. The
opening and shutting of the door caused a draught of air,
which, falling on the fainting Adah, restored her to consciousness,
and struggling to her feet, she tried to think
what it was that had happened. She remembered
it soon, and with a shudder listened to know if George
was still in the adjoining chamber. All was quiet there.
He had gone, and tottering into the room, she knelt by the
chair where she knew he had sat. Then, as the last expiring
throe of her love for him swept over her, she essayed
to wind her trembling arms around the chair, as she would
once have twined them about him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, George! George!” she gasped, calling him still
George, for, she almost hated that other name.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, George, I did love you so much,” and she laid her poor,
tired head upon the chair as if it had been his lap. “I
loved you so much, but it is over now, or it soon will be.
I feel its death struggles at my heart. You are worse
than I believed. You have made me an outcast, and Willie ——”
The sentence ended with the wailing cry—“My
boy, my boy! that such a heritage should be yours.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Adah could not pray then, although she tried, but the
fitting words would not come, and with her head still resting
on his chair, she looked the terrible reality in the
face, and saw just where she stood. Heretofore the one
great hope, that she was really a wife, had buoyed her up
when everything else was dark. Like a drowning person
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>grasping at a straw, she had clung to that, even against her
better judgment, but now it was swept away, and with it
the semblance of a name. He had deceived her even
there, and she had accepted the <em>Hastings</em> as something
tangible. He was a greater villain than she had imagined
a man could be, and again her white lips essayed to curse
him, but the rash act was stayed by the low words whispered
in her ear, “Forgive as ye would be forgiven.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If it were not for Willie, I might, but oh! my boy,
my boy disgraced,” was the rebellious spirit’s answer, when
again the voice whispered, “And who art thou to contend
against thy God? Know you not that I am the Father of
the fatherless.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There were tears now in Adah’s eyes, the first which
she had shed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll try,” she murmured, “try to forgive the wrong, but
the strength must all be thine,” and then, though there
came no sound or motion; her heart went out in agonizing
prayer, that she might forgive even as she hoped to
be forgiven.</p>

<p class='c011'>She did not ask that the dead love might ever return
again. She had no desire for that, but she asked to feel
kindly towards him, that the resentful feeling might be removed,
that God would show her what to do and where to
go, for she could not stay there now, in his home, whither
he would bring his bride ere many days were gone. She
must go away, not to Spring Bank, not anywhere where
he or ’Lina could ever find her. She would far rather die.
But Willie! what would she do with him, her tender, innocent
boy?</p>

<p class='c011'>“God tell me what to do with Willie?” she sobbed,
starting suddenly as the answer to her prayer seemed to
come at once. “Oh can I do that?” she moaned; “can
I leave him here?”</p>

<p class='c011'>At first her whole soul recoiled from it, but when she
remembered Anna, and how much she loved the child, her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>feelings began to change. Anna would love him more
when she knew he was poor Lily’s and her own brother’s.
She would be kind to him for his father’s sake, and for the
sake of the girl she had professed to like. Willie should
be bequeathed to Anna. It would break her heart to
leave him, were it not already broken, but it was better
so. It would be better in the end. He would forget her
in time, unless sweet Anna told him of her, as perhaps she
might. Dear Anna, how Adah longed to fold her arms
about her once and call her sister, but she must not. It
might not be well received, for Anna had some pride, as
her waiting-maid had learned.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A waiting-maid!” Adah repeated the name, smiling
bitterly as she thought, “A waiting-maid in his own
home! Who would have dreamed that I should ever
come to this, when he painted the future so grandly? Be
still, my heart, or I shall hate him yet, and I’m going to
forgive him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then there came over her the wild, yearning desire to
see his face once more, to know if he had changed, and
why couldn’t she? They supposed her gone to the office,
and she would go there now, taking the depot on the way.
She would go closely veiled, and none would suspect her
errand. Rising mechanically, she donned her cloak and
hood, and stealing down the stairs which led from Anna’s
room into the garden, she was soon out beneath
the starry sky, inhaling the cool night air, so grateful to
her heated brain.</p>

<hr class='c014'>

<p class='c011'>Apart in the ladies’ room at Snowdon depot, a veiled
figure sat, waiting apparently for the cars, just as others
were. She was the only female present, and no one had
noticed her particularly when she came in, for the gentlemen
walking up and down the room only glanced at her,
and then gave her no further thought. And there she sat,
Dr. Richards’ deserted wife, waiting to look on his face
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>once more ere she fled she knew not whither. He came
at last, Jim’s voice speaking to his horses heralding his approach.
Adah could not see him yet, but she knew just
when his feet struck the platform as he sprang from the
carriage, and shivered as if it were a blow aimed at her
heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>The group of rough-looking men gathered about the
office did not suit his mood, and so he came on to the ladies’ apartment,
just as Adah knew he would. Pausing
for a moment on the threshold, he looked hastily in, his
glance falling upon the veiled figure sitting there so
lonely and motionless. She did not care for him, she
would not object to his presence, so he came nearer to
the stove, poising his patent leathers upon the hearth,
thrusting both hands into his pockets, and even humming
to himself snatches of a song, which Lily used to sing, up
the three flights of stairs in that New York boarding-house.</p>

<p class='c011'>Poor Adah! How white and cold she grew, listening
to that air, and gazing upon the face she had loved so well.
It was changed since the night when, with his kiss warm
on her lips, he left her forever; changed, and for the worse.
There was a harder, a more reckless, determined expression
there, a look which better than words could have done,
told that <em>self</em> alone was the god he worshipped. Adah
doubted if he could have won her love with that look upon
his face, and ’Lina Worthington was not envied the
honor in store for her. It was a bitter struggle to sit
there so quietly, to meet the eye before which she was
wont to blush with happiness, to know that he was looking
at her, wondering it might be, who she was, but never
dreaming it was Lily.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once, as he walked up and down the room, passing so
near to her that she might have touched him with her
hand, she felt an almost irresistible desire to thrust her
thick brown veil aside, and confronting him to his face,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>claim from him what she had a right to claim, his name
and a position as his wife. Only for Willie’s sake, however
for herself she did not wish it. He was not worthy,
and forcing back the wild impulse, she sat with throbbing
heart and bloodless lips watching him, as he still
walked up and down, his brows knit together as if absorbed
in some unpleasant thought.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a relief when at last the roll of the cars was
heard, and buttoning his coat still closer around him, he
went out upon the platform and stepped mechanically into
the car.</p>

<p class='c011'>Quickly Adah, too, passed through the rear door out
into the street, and with a piteous moan for her ruined life,
kept on her way till the post-office was reached.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a letter for Anna in the box, and thrusting
it into her pocket Adah took her way back to Terrace
Hill.</p>

<p class='c011'>The family, including Anna, were spending the evening
in the parlor, where there were callers, and thus none
thought of or noticed Adah as she passed through the
hall and crept up to her room.</p>

<p class='c011'>Willie was asleep; and as Pamelia, who brought him
up, had thoughtfully undressed and placed him in bed,
there was nothing for Adah to do but think. She should
go away, of course; she could not stay there longer;
but how should she tell them why she went, and who
would be her medium, for communication?</p>

<p class='c011'>“Anna,” she whispered; and lighting her little lamp, she
sat down to write the letter which would tell Anna
Richards who was the waiting-maid to whom she had
been so kind.</p>

<p class='c011'>Adah was very calm when she began that letter, and as it
progressed, she seemed turning into stone, so insensible
she was to what, without that rigidity of nerve, would
have been a task more painful than she could well endure.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>“Dear Anna,” she wrote. “Forgive me for calling
you so this once, for indeed I cannot help it. I am going
away from you; and when, in the morning, you wait for
me to come as usual, I shall not be here. I could not
stay and meet your brother when he returns. Oh, Anna,
Anna, how shall I begin to tell you what I know will
grieve and shock your pure nature so dreadfully?</p>

<p class='c011'>“I love to call you Anna now, for you seem near to
me; and believe me, while I write this to you, I am conscious
of no feeling of inferiority to any one bearing
your proud name. I am, or should have been, <em>your sister</em>;
and Willie!—oh, my boy, when I think of him, I
seem to be going mad!</p>

<p class='c011'>“Cannot you guess?—don’t you know now who I
am? God forgive your brother, as I asked him to do,
kneeling there by the very chair where he sat an hour
since, talking to you of <em>Lily</em>. I heard him, and the
sound of his voice took power and strength away. I
could not move to let you know I was there, and I lay
upon the floor till consciousness forsook me; and then,
when I woke again, you both were gone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I went to the depot, I saw him in his face to make
assurance sure, and Anna, I,—oh I don’t know what I
am. The world would not call me a wife, though I believed
I was; but they cannot deal thus cruelly by Willie,
or wash from his veins his father’s blood, for I—,who
write this, I who have been a servant in the house
where I should have been the mistress, am <em>Lily</em>—wronged,
deserted Lily—and Willie is your brother’s
child! His father’s looks are in his face. But when I
came here I had no suspicion, for he won me as <em>George
Hastings</em>; that was the name by which I knew him, and
I was <em>Adah Gordon</em>. If you do not believe me, ask him
when he comes back if ever in his wanderings he met
with Adah Gordon, or her guardian, Mr. Redfield. Ask
if he was ever present at a marriage where this Adah
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>gave her heart to one for whom she would then have lost
her life, erring in that she loved the <em>gift</em> more than the
<em>giver</em>; but God punishes idolatry, and he has punished
me, so sorely, oh so sorely, that sometimes my fainting
soul cries out, ‘’tis more than I can bear.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then followed more particulars so that there should be
no doubt, and then the half crazed Adah took up the
theme nearest to her heart, her boy, her beautiful Willie.
She could not take him with her. She knew not where
she was going, and Willie must not suffer. Would <em>Anna</em>
take the child? Would she love him for his father’s
sake? Would she shield him from scorn, and when he
was older would she sometimes tell him of the mother
who went away that <em>he</em> might be spared shame?</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not ask that the new bride should ever call him
hers,” she wrote; “I’d rather she would not. I ask that
you should give him a mother’s care, and if his father
will sometimes speak kindly to him for the sake of the
olden time when he did love the mother, tell him—Willie’s
father, I mean—tell him, oh I know not what
to bid you tell him, except that I forgive him, though at
first it was so hard, and the words refused to come; I
trusted him so much, loved him so much, and until I had
it from his own lips, believed I was his wife. But that
cured me; that killed the love, if any still existed, and
now, if I could, I would not be his, unless it were for
Willie’s sake. Don’t deem me too proud when I say, that
to be his wife would be to me more terrible than any thing
which I yet have borne, except it were for Willie. I say
this because it’s possible your kind heart would prompt
you at once to bring back your erring brother, and persuade
him at the last to do me justice. But I would not
have it so. Shield Willie; nurture him tenderly; teach
your mother to love him, and if you so desire it, I will
never cross his path, never come near to him, though at a
distance, if Heaven wills it, I shall watch my child.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>“And now farewell. God deal with you, dear Anna,
as you deal with my boy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Calmly, steadily, Adah folded up the missive, and laying
it with the other letter, busied herself next in making
the necessary preparations for her flight. Anna had been
very liberal with her in point of wages, paying her every
week, and paying more than at first agreed upon; and as
she had scarcely spent a penny during her three months’
sojourn at Terrace Hill, she had, including what Alice
had given to her, nearly forty dollars. She was trying so
hard to make it a hundred, and so send it to Hugh some
day; but she needed it most herself, and she placed it
carefully in her little purse, sighing over the golden coin
which Anna had paid her last, little dreaming for what
purpose it would be used. She would not change her
dress until Anna had retired, as that might excite suspicion;
so with the same rigid apathy of manner she sat
down by Willie’s side and waited till Anna was
heard moving in her room. The lamp was burning dimly
on the bureau, and so Anna failed to see the frightful
expression of Adah’s face as she performed her accustomed
duties, brushing Anna’s hair, and letting her hands linger
caressingly amid the locks she might never touch
again.</p>

<p class='c011'>It did strike Anna that something was the matter; for
when Adah spoke to her, the voice was husky and unnatural.
Still, she paid no attention, and the chapter was
read as usual, after which Adah bade her good night and
went to her own room. Anna slept very soundly, and
when toward morning a light footstep glided across her
threshold she did not hear it, neither did she know when
two letters were laid softly on her pillow, where she could
not fail to find them when she awoke, nor yet was she
aware of the blessings breathed over her, as kneeling by
her side Adah prayed out her farewell. Not wept. She
could not do that, even when it came to leaving Willie.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>Her tears were frozen into stone, and the mighty throes
of anguish which seemed forcing her heart from its natural
position were of no avail to moisten the feverish lids,
drooping so heavily over the swollen eyes. A convulsive
prayer, in which her whole soul was embodied, a gasping
sob of bitter, bitter pain, and then Adah put from her the
little soft, warm, baby arm which Willie had unconsciously
thrown across her neck when she laid her face by his.
She dared not look at him again lest the sight should unnerve
her, and with a decision born of desperation, she left
her sleeping boy and hurried down the stairs into the
gloomy hall, where not a sound was audible as her feet
pressed the soft thick carpet on her passage to the outer
door. The bolt was drawn, the key was turned, and just
as the clock struck three, Adah stood outside the yard,
leaning on the gate and gazing back at the huge building
looming up so dark and grand beneath the starry sky.
One more prayer for Willie and the mother-auntie to whose
care she had left him, one more straining glance at the
window of the little room where he lay sleeping, and she
resolutely turned away, nor stopped again until the Danville
depot was reached, the station where, in less than five
minutes after her arrival, the night express stood for an instant,
and then went thundering on, bearing with it another
passenger, bound for—she knew not, cared not whither.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXX.<br> <span class='large'>EXCITEMENT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>They were not early risers at Terrace Hill, and the
morning following Adah’s flight Anna slept later than
usual; nor was it until Willie’s cry, calling for mamma,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>was heard, that she awoke, and thinking Adah had gone
down for something, bade Willie come to her. Putting
out her arms she lifted him carefully into her own bed,
and in so doing brushed from her pillow the letters left
for her. But it did not matter then, and for a full half
hour she lay waiting for Adah’s return. Growing impatient
at last, she stepped upon the floor, her bare feet touching
something cold, something which made her look down
and find that she was stepping on a letter—not one, but
two—and in wondering surprise she turned them to the
light, half fainting with excitement, when on the back of
the first one examined, she saw the old familiar handwriting,
and knew that Charlie had written.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna had hardly been human had she waited an instant
ere she tore open the envelope and learned that Charlie
had returned from India and had not forgotten her. The
love of his early manhood had increased with his maturer
years, and he could not be satisfied until he heard from
her that he was remembered and still beloved, that if this
letter did not bring a reply he should come himself and
brave the proud woman who guarded the entrance to Terrace
Hill.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was Charlie’s letter, this what Anna read, and delicious
tears of joy flowed over her beautiful face, as
pressing the paper to her lips, she murmured,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear Charlie! darling Charlie! I thank the kind Father
for bringing him at last to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hiding it in her bosom, Anna took the other letter, and
throwing her shawl around her, sat down by the window
and read it through—read it once, read it twice, read it
thrice, and then——Sure never were the inmates of Terrace
Hill thrown into so much astonishment and alarm as
they were that April morning, when, in her cambric night
robe, her long hair falling unbound about her shoulders,
and her bare feet, gleaming white and cold upon the floor,
Miss Anna went screaming from room to room, demanding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>of the startled inmates if they had seen Adah Hastings—if
they knew where she had gone—bidding Jim
find her at his peril, telling Pamelia to join in the search,
and asking her wonder-stricken mother and sisters “if they
had any idea who it was that had been an inmate of their
house for so many weeks.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come with me,” she almost screamed, and dragging
her mother to her room, where <em>Willie</em> sat up in bed, looking
curiously about him and uncertain whether to cry or
to laugh, she exclaimed, “Look at him, mother, and you,
too, Asenath and Eudora!” turning to her sisters, who had
followed. “Tell me who is he like?—Mother, surely
you ought to know—ought to recognize your own son’s
offspring, for he is, he certainly is, John’s child! and Adah
was Lily, the young girl whom you forbade him to marry!
Listen, mother, you shall listen to what your pride has
done!” and grasping the bewildered Mrs. Richards by
the arm, Anna held her fast while she read aloud the
letter left by Adah.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Richards fainted. It was the best thing under the
circumstance which she could do, as it gave them all a
little diversion from the exciting matter in hand. She
soon recovered, however, and listened eagerly while Anna
repeated all her brother had ever told her of Lily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I believe it is true,” she said, and taking the letter she
read it for herself, feeling an added respect for Adah, as she
marked the flashes of pride gleaming out here and there,
and showing themselves in the resentful manner with
which she spurned the thought of now being the doctor’s
wife, except it were for Willie.</p>

<p class='c011'>Poor Willie! He was there in the bed, looking curiously
at the four women, none of whom seemed quite
willing to own him, save Anna. Her heart took him in at
once. He had been given to her. She would be faithful
to the trust, and folding him in her arms, she cried softly
over him, kissing his little face and calling him her darling.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>“Anna, how can you fondle such as he?” Eudora asked,
rather sharply, for her nature was the hardest, coldest of
them all, and rebelled against the innocent boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is our brother’s child. Our blood is in his veins,
and that is why we all must love him. Mother, you will
not turn from your grandson,” and Anna held the boy
toward her mother, who did not refuse to take him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Asenath always went with her mother, and at once
showed signs of relenting by laying her hand on Willie’s
head and calling him “poor boy.” Eudora held out
longer, but Anna knew she would yield in time, and
satisfied with Willie’s reception so far, went on to speak
of Adah. Where was she, did they suppose, and what
were the best means of finding her.</p>

<p class='c011'>At this Mrs. Richards demurred, as did Asenath with
her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Adah was gone, and they had better let her go
quietly. She was nothing to them, and if they took
Willie, it was all that could be required of them. Had
Adah been John’s wife, it would of course be different,
but she was not, and his marriage with ’Lina must not
now be prevented. Neither must any one save themselves
and John ever know who Willie was. It was not necessary
to bruit their affairs abroad. It was very wicked
and bad in John, of course, but other young men were as
bad.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was Mrs. Richards’ reasoning, but Anna’s was
different.</p>

<p class='c011'>“John had distinctly said, ‘I married Lily, and she
died.’ Adah was mistaken about the marriage being unlawful.
It was a falsehood he told her. She was his
wife, and he must not be permitted to commit bigamy,
He loved Lily far better than he did ’Lina. He would
move heaven and earth to find her, did he know that she
was living. And he should know of it. She was going to
Kentucky herself to tell him. She would not trust to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>the telegraph, and should start that very night. There
would be no scene. She would only tell John in private.
They need not try to dissuade her, for she should go.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was what Anna said, and all in vain were her
mother’s entreaties to let matters take their course. Anna
only replied by going deliberately on with the preparations
for her sudden journey, pausing now and then to
dream a moment over her own new happiness, taking the
letter from her bosom and whispering, “Dear Charlie,”
and then as Willie cried for his mother, she essayed to
quiet him, hugging him in her arms and mingling her
own tears with his. The servants were told that Mrs.
Hastings had run away, Eudora, the informer, hinting of
insanity, and so this accounted for the sudden interest
manifested for Willie by the other ladies, who had him
in at their breakfast, and kept him with them in the parlor
in spite of Pamelia’s endeavors to coax him away.
This accounted, too, for Anna’s journey. She was going
to find Adah, and blessing her for this kindness to one
whom they had liked so much, Dixson and Pamelia
helped to get her ready, both promising the best of care
to Willie in her absence, both asking where she was
going first, and both receiving the same answer, “To Albany.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Richards was too much stunned clearly to comprehend
what had happened or what would be the result;
and in a kind of apathetic maze she bade Anna
good-bye, and then went back to where Willie sat upon
the sofa examining and occasionally tearing the costly
book of foreign prints which had been given him to
keep him still and make him cease his piteous wail for
“mam-ma.” It seemed like a dream to the three ladies
sitting at home that night and talking about Anna; wondering
that a person of her weak nerves and feeble health
should suddenly become so active, so energetic, so decided,
and of her own accord start off on a long journey
alone and unprotected.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>And Anna wondered at herself when the excitement
of leaving was past, and the train was bearing her swiftly
along on her mission of duty. She had written a few
lines to Charlie Millbrook, telling him of her unaltered
love, and bidding him come to her in three weeks time,
when she would be ready to see him. She had unselfishly
put the interview off thus long because she did not
know what might occur in the interim, and when he
came she wished to be quiet and free from all excitement.
She had herself dropped the letter in the post-office as
she came down to the depot. She knew it was safe, and
leaning back in her seat in the car she felt a happy
peace which nothing could disturb, not even thoughts of
Adah—Lily she called her—wandering she knew not
where.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was very dark and rainy, and the passengers jostled
each other rudely as they passed from the cars in Albany
and hurried to the boat. It was new business to Anna,
traveling alone and in the night, and a feeling akin to
fear was creeping over her as she wondered <em>where</em> she
<em>should</em> find the eastern train.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Follow the crowd,” seemed yelled out for her benefit,
though it was really intended for a timid, deaf old lady,
who had anxiously asked what to do of one whose laconic
reply was, “Follow the crowd.” And Anna did follow
the crowd, which led her safely to the waiting cars.
Snugly ensconced in a seat all to herself, she vainly imagined
there was no more trouble until Cleveland, or
Buffalo at least, was reached. How, then, was she disappointed
when, alighting for a moment at Rochester, she
found herself in a worse Babel, if possible, than had existed
at Albany. Where were all these folks going, and
which was the train. “I ought not to have alighted at
all,” she thought; “I might have known I never could
find my way back.” Never, sure, was a poor, little woman
so confused and bewildered as Anna, and it is not strange
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>that she stood directly upon the track, unmindful of the
increasing din and roar as the train from Niagara Falls
came thundering into the depot. It was in vain that the
cabman nearest to her halloed to warn her of the impending
danger. She never dreamed that they meant her,
or suspected her great peril, until from out the group
waiting to take that very train, a tall figure sprang, and
grasping her light form round the waist, bore her to a
place of safety—not because he guessed that it was <em>Annie</em>,
but because it was a human being whom he would
save from a fearful death.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Excuse me, madam,” he began, as with the long train
between them and the people, they stood comparatively
alone, but whatever she might have said was lost in the
low, thrilling scream of joy with which Anna recognized
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Charlie, Charlie! oh, Charlie!” she cried, burying her
face in his bosom and sobbing like a child.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no time to waste in explanations; scarcely
time, indeed, for Charlie to ask where she was going, and
if the necessity to go on were imperative. If her arrangements
could not bend to his, why his must bend to hers,
and unmindful of the audience away to the eastward
who would that night wait in vain for the appearance of
Mr. Millbrook, the returned missionary, Charlie wound his
arm around the half fainting form, dearer than his own
life, and carried rather than led her to a seat in the car
just on the point of rolling from the depot.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You won’t leave me,” Anna whispered, clinging closer
to him, as she remembered how improbable it was that
he was going the same way with herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Leave you, darling? no,” and pressing the little fingers
twining so lovingly about his own, Charlie replied,
“I shall not leave you again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He needed no words to tell him of her unaltered love,
and satisfied to have her at last, he drew her closely to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>him, and laying her tired head upon his bosom, gazed
fondly at the face he had not seen in many years. That
dear face he had once thought so beautiful and had
dreamed about so often, even when another was sleeping
at his side, was it changed? Yes, slightly. The
fresh, girlish bloom of only eighteen summers was gone,
but Anna wore her thirty-three years lightly, and if
possible, the maturer face was more beautiful to Charlie
than the laughing maiden’s had been, for he traced
on it unmistakable marks of that peace which Anna had
found in her later life; and without questioning her at
all, Charlie Millbrook knew his darling Anna had chosen
the better part, and that in the next world she would
be his, even as he hoped to call her his own for the remainder
of his sojourn on earth. Curious, tittering maidens,
of whom there are usually one or two in every car,
looked at that couple near the door and whispered to their
companions,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bride and groom. Just see how he hugs her. Some
widower, I know, married to a young wife.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But neither Charlie nor Anna cared for the speculations
to which they were giving rise. They had found each
other, and the happiness enjoyed during the two hours
which elapsed ere Buffalo was reached, more than made
amends for all the lonely years of wretchedness they had
spent apart from each other. Charlie had told Anna briefly
of his life in India—had spoken feelingly, affectionately,
of his gentle Hattie, who had died, blessing him with
her last breath for the kindness he had ever shown to her;
of baby Annie’s grave, by the side of which he buried
the young mother; of his loneliness after that, his failing
health, his yearning for a sight of home, his embarkation
for America, his hope through all that she might still be
won; and his letter which she received. And then Anna
told him where she was going, sparing her brother as much
as possible, and dwelling long upon poor Lily’s gentleness
and beauty.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>So it was settled that Charley should go with her, and
his presence made her far less impatient than she would
otherwise have been, when, owing to some accident, they
were delayed so long that the Cleveland train was gone,
and there was no alternative but to wait in Buffalo. At
Cincinnati there was another detention, and it was not
until the very day appointed for the wedding that, with
Charlie still beside her, Anna entered the carriage hired
at Lexington, and started for Spring Bank, whither for a
little we will precede her, taking up the narrative prior to
this day, and about the time when ’Lina first returned
home from New York, laden with arrogance and airs.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXI.<br> <span class='large'>MATTERS AT STRING BANK.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>It had been a bright, pleasant day in March, when ’Lina
was expected home, and in honor of her arrival the house
at Spring Bank wore its most cheery aspect; not that any
one was particularly pleased because she was coming, unless
it were the mother; but it was still an event of some
importance, and so the negroes cleaned and scrubbed and
scoured, wondering if “Miss ’Lina done fotch ’em anything,”
while Alice arranged and re-arranged the plainly-furnished
rooms, feeling beforehand how the contrast between them
and the elegancies to which ’Lina had recently been accustomed,
would affect her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hugh had thought of the same thing, and much as it
hurt him to do it, he sold one of his pet colts, and giving
the proceeds to Alice, bade her use it as she saw fit.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was astonishing how far Alice made the hundred
dollars go. Hugh had no idea it would buy so much, and
in blissful ignorance that Alice herself had supplied many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>articles from her own funds, he assisted in nailing down
carpets and oil-cloths, and putting up curtains, while he
even ventured to try his hand at painting, succeeding admirably,
but spoiling an entire suit of clothes, and leaving
more than one mark of his brush on Alice’s black dress.
Spring Bank had never looked one-half so well before, and
the negroes were positive there was no where to be found
so handsome a room as the large airy parlor, with its new
Brussels carpet and curtains of worsted brocatelle.</p>

<p class='c011'>Even Hugh was somewhat of the same opinion, but
then he only looked at the room with Alice standing in
its centre, so it is not strange that he should judge it favorably.
Ad would be pleased, he knew, and he gave orders
that the carriage and harness should be thoroughly
cleaned, and the horses well groomed, for he would make
a good impression upon his sister.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alas, she was not worth the trouble,—the proud, selfish
creature, who, all the way from Lexington to the Big
Spring station had been hoping <em>Hugh</em> would not take it
into his head to meet her, or if he did, that he would not
have on his homespun suit of grey, with his pants tucked
in his boots, and so disgrace her in the eyes of Mr. and
Mrs. Ford, her traveling companions, who would see him
from the window. Yes, there he was, standing expectantly
upon the platform, and she turned her head the other
way, pretending not to see him until the train moved on,
and Hugh compelled her notice by grasping her hand and
calling her “sister ’Lina.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She had acquired a certain city air by her sojourn in
New York, and in her fashionably made traveling dress
and hat was far more stylish looking than when Hugh
last parted from her. But nothing abashed he held her
hand a moment while he inquired about her journey, and
then playfully added,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Upon my word, Ad, you have improved a heap, in
looks I mean. Of course I don’t know about the temper.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>Spunky as ever, eh?” and he tried to pinch her glowing
cheek.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pray don’t be foolish,” was ’Lina’s impatient reply, as
she drew away from him, and turned, with her blandest
smile, to a sprig of a lawyer from Frankfort, who chanced
to be there too.</p>

<p class='c011'>Chilled by her manner, Hugh ordered the carriage, and
told her they were ready. Once alone with him, ’Lina’s
tongue was loosened, and she poured out numberless
questions, the first of which was, “What they heard from
Adah, and if it were true, as her mother had written, that
no one at Terrace Hill knew of her acquaintance with
Spring Bank.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, he supposed it was, and he did not like it either.
Ad,” and he turned his honest face full toward her, “does
that doctor still believe you rich?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How do I know?” ’Lina replied, frowning gloomily.
“I’m not to blame if he does. I never told him I was.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But your actions implied as much, which amounts to
the same thing. It’s all wrong, Ad, all wrong. Even if
he loves you, and it is to be hoped he does, he will respect
you less when he knows how you deceived him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hadn’t you better interfere and set the matter right?”
asked ’Lina, now really roused.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I did think of doing so once,” Hugh rejoined, but ere
he could say more, ’Lina grasped his arm fiercely, her face
dark with passion as she exclaimed, “Hugh, if you meddle, you’ll rue the day. It’s my own
affair, and I know what I’m doing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She was very angry, and her black eyes fairly blazed as
they glanced at Hugh, who once would have returned her
scorn for scorn. But Hugh was learning to govern his hot
temper. The diamond was polishing; besides that, he
would not quarrel with her on this first day of her return,
so he answered in the same kind tone of voice he
had assumed toward her.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>“I do not intend to meddle, though I encouraged Adah
in her wild plan of going to Terrace Hill, because I thought
they would learn from her just how rich we are. But
Adah foolishly says nothing of Spring Bank. I don’t like
it, neither does Miss Johnson. Indeed, I sometimes think
she is more anxious than I am.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Miss Johnson,” and ’Lina spoke disdainfully, “I’d
thank her to mind her own business. She’s only jealous
and wants the doctor herself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hugh made her no reply, and they proceeded on in
silence, until they came in sight of Spring Bank, when
’Lina broke out afresh, “Such a tumble-down shanty as that! It was not fit for
decent people to live in, and mercy knew she was glad her
sojourn there was to be short.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are not alone in that feeling,” came dryly from
Hugh, who could not forbear that remark.</p>

<p class='c011'>’Lina said he was a very affectionate brother; that she
was glad there were those who appreciated her, even if
he did not, and then the carriage stopped at Spring Bank,
where the family stood waiting for her upon the long
piazza. Mrs. Worthington was hearty in her welcome, for
her mother heart went out warmly towards her daughter,
who, as bride-elect of a Richards, was, in her estimation, a
creature of more importance than plain ’Lina had been,
with nothing in prospect. Oh, what airs ’Lina did put on,
and what pains she took to appear <em>cityfied</em>, merely noticing
the expectant negroes with a “how dye,” offering the tips
of her fingers to good Aunt Eunice, trying to patronize
Alice herself, and only noticing Densie Densmore with a
haughty stare.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Upon my word,” ’Lina began, as she entered the
pleasant parlor, “this is better than I expected. Somebody
has been very kind for my sake. Miss Johnson, I am
sure it’s you I have to thank,” and with a little flush of
gratitude she turned to Alice, who replied in a low tone,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>“Thank your brother. He made a sacrifice for the sake
of surprising you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Whether it was a desire to appear amiable in Alice’s
eyes, or because she really was touched with Hugh’s generosity,
’Lina involuntarily threw her arm around his
neck, and gave to him a kiss which he remembered for a
long, long time.</p>

<p class='c011'>Swiftly the days went by, bringing callers to see ’Lina,
Ellen Tiffton, who received back her jewelry, and who
was to be bridesmaid, inasmuch as Alice preferred to be
more at liberty, and see that matters went on properly.
This brought Ellen often to Spring Bank, and as ’Lina
was much with her, Alice was left more time to think.
Adah’s continued silence with regard to Dr. Richards had
troubled her at first, but now she felt relieved. ’Lina
had stated distinctly that ere coming to Kentucky he was
going to Terrace Hill, and Adah’s last letter had said the
same. She would see him then, and—if he were George—alas,
for the unsuspecting girl who fluttered gaily
in the midst of her bridal finery, and wished the time
would come when “she could escape from that hole, and
go back to dear, delightful Fifth Avenue Hotel.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The time which hung so heavily upon her hands was
flying rapidly, and at last only a week intervened ere the
eventful day. Hugh had gone down to Frankfort on an
errand to the dressmaker’s for ’Lina, and finding that he
must wait some time, it occurred to him to visit the Penitentiary,
where he had not been for a long time. The
keeper, a personal friend of Hugh’s, expressed much
pleasure at meeting him, and after a moment, said laughingly,</p>

<p class='c011'>“We have no <em>lions</em> to show just now, unless it be Sullivan,
the negro stealer. You have never seen him, I think,
since he was sent to us. You know whom I mean, the
man who ran off Uncle Sam.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Yes, Hugh knew, but he was not especially interested
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>in him. Still he followed the keeper, who said that Sullivan’s
time expired in a few days.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We’ll find him on the rope-walk,” he continued. “We
put our hardest customers there. Not that he gives us
trouble, for he does not, and I rather like the chap, but
we have a spite against these Yankee negro-stealers,” and
he led the way to the long low room, where groups of
men walked up and down—up and down—holding the
long line of hemp, which, as far as they were concerned,
would never come to an end until the day of their release.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s he,” the keeper whispered to Hugh, “the one
with that mark upon his forehead,” and he pointed to one
of the convicts advancing slowly towards them.</p>

<p class='c011'>With a start and a shudder Hugh grew cold and sick,
for it needed but a glance to assure him that he stood in
the presence of Adah’s guardian, whose sudden disappearance
had been so mysterious. Hugh never knew how he
kept himself from leaping into that walk and compelling
him to tell if he knew anything of Willie Hastings’ father.
He did, indeed, take one forward step, but the next moment
he controlled himself as he remembered where he
was, and knew it was no place for a scene. “But I must
see him,” he thought, “I must talk with him and compel
him to tell me what he knows of Adah Hastings.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hastily quitting the spot, he explained to the keeper
that there was a particular reason for his talking with
Sullivan, and asked permission to do so. At first the
keeper hesitated, but finally consented, and an hour later,
when the convicts left their work, Hugh Worthington
was confronting the famous negro-stealer, who gave him
back glance for glance, and stood unflinchingly before him
as if there were upon his conscience no Adah Hastings,
who, by his connivance, had been so terribly wronged.
At the mention of <em>her</em> name, however, his bold assurance
left him. There was a quivering of the muscles about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>his mouth, a humid moisture upon his eyelids, and his
whole manner was indicative of strong emotion as he asked
if Hugh knew aught of her, and then listened while
Hugh told what he knew, and where she had gone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To Terrace Hill—into the Richards family, this was
no chance arrangement,” and the convict spoke huskily
asking next for the doctor, was he at home? had he met
Adah yet? and still Hugh did not suspect the magnitude
of the plot, and answered by telling how Dr. Richards
was coming soon to make ’Lina his wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hugh was not looking at his companion then, or he
would have been appalled by the fearful expression which
for an instant flashed on his face, and then quickly passed
away, leaving there a look of terror and concern. Accustomed
to conceal his feelings, the convict did so now, and
asked calmly when the wedding would take place.
Hugh named the day and hour, and then asked impatiently,
if Sullivan knew aught of Adah’s husband.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, everything,” and the convict spoke vehemently,
for he, too, saw the keeper consult his watch, and knew
that he must hasten.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Young man, I cannot tell you now—there is not time,
but wait and you shall know the whole. You are interested
in Adah. You have been kind to her. You never
will be sorry. The wedding, you say, is Thursday night.
My time expires on Wednesday.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t say that you have seen me, or that I shall be
present at that wedding. I shall only come for good, but
I shall surely be there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He wrung Hugh’s hand and went to his lonely cell, while
Hugh turned away, haunted by some presentiment of evil,
and hearing continually the words, fraught with far more
meaning than he supposed, “I shall surely be there.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXII.<br> <span class='large'>THE DAY OF THE WEDDING.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Dr. Richards had arrived at Spring Bank. He, too,
had been detained in Cincinnati, and did not reach his
destination until late on Wednesday evening. Hugh was
the first to meet him, for Alice had retired, and ’Lina had
fled from the room at the first sound of the voice she had
been so anxiously waiting for. For a moment Hugh scrutinized
the stranger’s face earnestly, and then asked if they
had never met before.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not to my knowledge,” the doctor replied in perfect
good faith, for he had no suspicion that the man eyeing
him so closely was the one witness of his marriage with
Adah, the stranger whom he scarcely noticed, and whose
name he had forgotten.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once fully in the light, where Hugh could discern the
features plainer, he began to be less sure of having met
his guest before, for that immense mustache and those
well-trimmed whiskers, had changed the doctor’s physiognomy
materially.</p>

<p class='c011'>’Lina now came stealing in, affecting such a pretty coyness
of manner, that Hugh felt like roaring with laughter
and ere long hurried out where he could indulge his merriment.</p>

<p class='c011'>’Lina was glad to see the doctor. She had even cried
at his delay; and though no one knew it, had sat up nearly
the whole preceding night, waiting and listening by her
open window for any sound to herald his approach, and
once she had stolen out with her thin slippers into the
yard, standing on the damp ground a long time, and only
returning to the house when she felt a chill creeping over
her, and knew she was taking cold.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the result of this long vigil, her head ached dreadfully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>the next day, and even the doctor noticed her burning
cheeks and watery eyes, and feeling her rapid pulse
asked if she were ill.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was not, she said; she had only been troubled,
because he did not come, and then for once in her life she
did a womanly act. She laid her head in the doctor’s lap
and cried, just as she had done the previous night. He
understood the cause of her tears at last, and touched with
a greater degree of tenderness for her than he had ever
before experienced, he smoothed her glossy black hair, and
asked, “Would you be very sorry to lose me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Selfish and hard as she was, ’Lina loved the doctor, and
with a shudder as she thought of the deception imposed
on him, and a half regret that she had so deceived him,
she replied, “I am not worthy of you, but I do love you very much,
and it would kill me to lose you now. Promise that
when you find, as you will, how bad I am, you will not
hate me!”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was an attempt at confession, but the doctor did not
so construe it. Whatever her errors were, his, he knew,
were tenfold greater, and so he continued smoothing her
hair, while he tried to say the words of affection he knew
she was waiting to hear.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was very dark that night, and the doctor received
only a vague idea of Spring Bank and its surroundings,
and that did not impress him as grandly as he had thought
it would. But then, he reflected that Southerners were
not as noted for fine houses as Northerners were, and so
felt secure as yet, wondering which of the negroes he had
seen belonged to ’Lina, and which to Hugh. He knew
Lulu was not to accompany his wife to Terrace Hill, for
’Lina had told him so, saying that in the present state of
excited feeling she did not think it best to take a negro
slave to New England. He knew, too, that nothing had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>been said about money or lands coming to him with his
bride, but he took it all on trust, and looked rather
complacently around the prettily furnished chamber to
which, at a late hour, he was conducted by Hugh.</p>

<p class='c011'>The bright sunlight of the next morning was very exhilarating,
and though the doctor was disappointed in
Spring Bank, he greeted his bride-elect kindly, noticing,
when he did so, how her cheeks alternately paled, and
then grew red, while she seemed to be chilly and cold.
’Lina had passed a wretched night, tossing from side to
side, bathing her throbbing head and rubbing her aching
limbs. The severe cold taken in the wet yard was making
itself visible, and she came to the breakfast-table jaded
wretched and sick, a striking contrast to Alice Johnson,
who seemed to the doctor more beautiful than ever. She
was unusually gay this morning, for while talking to Dr.
Richards, whom she had met in the parlor, she had, among
other things concerning Snowdon, said to him, casually, as
it seemed, “Anna has a waiting-maid at last: You saw her of
course?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Somehow the doctor fancied Alice wished him to say
yes, and as a falsehood was nothing for him, he replied at
once, “Oh, yes, I saw her. Her little boy is splendid.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice was satisfied. The shadow lifted from her spirits.
Dr. Richards was not George Hastings. He was not the
villain she had feared, and ’Lina might have him now.
Poor ’Lina! Alice felt almost as if she had done her a
wrong by suspecting the doctor, and was very kind to her
that day. Poor ’Lina! we say it again, for hard, and
wicked, and treacherous, and unfilial, as she had ever been,
she had need for pity on this her wedding day. Retribution
terrible and crushing, was at hand, hurrying on in
the carriage bringing Anna Richards to Spring Bank, and
on the fleet-footed steed bearing the convict swiftly up
the Frankfort ‘pike.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>Restless and impatient ’Lina wandered from room to
room, stopping longest in the one where lay the bridal
dress, at which she gazed wistfully, feeling almost as if it
were her shroud. She could not tell what ailed her. She
only knew that she felt wretchedly, as if some direful calamity
were about to overtake her, and more than once
her eyes filled with tears as she wished her path to Dr.
Richards’ name had been marked with no deception.
He was now in his room, and it was almost time for her
to dress. Lulu might begin to arrange her hair, and she
called her just as the mud-bespattered vehicle containing
Anna Richards drove up, Mr. Millbrook having purposely
stopped in Versailles, thinking it better that Anna
should go on alone.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was Ellen Tiffton, who was to come early, ’Lina
said, and so the dressing continued, and she was all unsuspicious
of the scene enacting below, in the room
where Anna met her brother alone. She had not given
Hugh her name. She simply asked for Dr. Richards, and
conducting her into the parlor, hung with bridal decorations,
Hugh went for the doctor, saying, “a lady wished
to see him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A lady! Who is it?” the doctor asked, visions of
his aggrieved mother, in her black silk velvet, rising before
his mind. “What could a lady and a stranger want
of him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mechanically he took his way to the parlor, while
Hugh resumed his seat by the window, where for the
last hour he had watched for the coming of one who had
said, “I will be there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Half an hour later, had he looked into the parlor, he
would have seen a frightened, white-faced man, crouching
at Anna Richards’ side and whispering to her as if
all life, all strength, all power to act for himself, were
gone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What must I do? Tell me what to do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She had given him no time for questioning, but handing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>him Adah’s letter, had bidden him read it through,
as that would explain her presence at Spring Bank.
One glance at the handwriting, and the doctor turned
white as marble. “Could it be? Had Lily come back
to life?” he asked himself, and then eagerly, rapidly, he
read the first two pages, every word burning into his
heart and bewildering his brain. But when he came to
the line, “<em>I am Lily, and Willie is your brother’s child</em>,”
sight and sense seemed failing him, and tottering to his
sister, sternly regarding him, he gasped, “Oh, Anna, read
for me. I can’t see any more—it runs together, and I—I’m
going to faint!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>No, you are not.</em> You must not faint; you shall
not,” Anna exclaimed, shaking him energetically and applying
to his nostrils the bottle of strong hartshorn she
had procured in Versailles for just such an emergency as
this.</p>

<p class='c011'>The odor half strangled him, but Anna’s object was attained.
He did not faint, but sat like an idiotic thing,
listening while she read the letter through, and demanded
if it were true. Was it Adah Gordon whom he deserted,
and was it a mock marriage? She would have the
truth, and he had no desire to conceal it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, true—all true—but I thought she was dead.
I did, Anna. Oh, Lily, where is she now? I’m going
to——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sit down,” Anna said, imperatively; and with all the
air of an imbecile he crouched at her feet, asking what
he should do.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was a puzzle to Anna, and she replied by asking
him another question. “Do you love ’Lina Worthington?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I—I—no, I guess I don’t; but she’s rich, and——”</p>

<p class='c011'>With a motion of disgust Anna cut him short, saying,
“Don’t make me despise you more than I do. Until
your lips confessed it, I had faith that Lily was mistaken,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>that your marriage was honorable, at least, even if you
tired of it afterward. You are worse than I supposed
and now you speak of money. What shall you do? Get
up, and not sit whining at my feet like a puppy. Find
Lily, of course, and if she will stoop to listen a second
time to your suit, make her your wife, working to support
her until your hands are blistered, if need be.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna hardly knew herself in this phase of her character,
and her brother certainly did not.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t be hard on me, Anna,” he said, “I’ll do what
you say, only don’t be hard. It’s come so sudden, that
my head is like a whirlpool. Lily, Willie, Willie. The
child I saw, you mean—yes, the child—I—saw—did
it say he—was—<em>my</em>—boy?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The words were thick and far apart. The head drooped
lower and lower, the color all left the lips, and in spite
of Anna’s vigorous shakes, or still more vigorous hartshorn,
overtaxed nature gave way, and the doctor fainted
at last. It was Anna’s turn now to wonder what she
should do, and she was about summoning aid from some
quarter when the door opened suddenly, and Hugh ushered
in a stranger—the convict, who had kept his word,
and came to tell what he knew of this complicated mystery.
No one had seen him as he entered the house but
Hugh, who was expecting him, and who, in reply to his
inquiries for the doctor, told where he was, and that a
stranger was with him. There was a low, hurried conversation
between the two, a partial revelation of the business
which had brought Sullivan there, and at its close
Hugh’s face was deadly white, for he knew now that he
had met Dr. Richards before, and that ’Lina could not be
his wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The villain!” he muttered, involuntarily clenching his
fist as if to smite the dastard as he followed Sullivan into
the parlor, starting back when he saw the prostrate form
upon the floor, and heard the lady say, “My brother, sir,
has fainted.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>She was Anna, then; and Hugh guessed rightly why
she was there.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Madame,” he began, but ere another word was uttered
there fell upon his ear a shriek which seemed to cleave the
very air and made even the fainting man move in his unconsciousness.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was Mrs. Worthington who, with hands outstretched
as if to keep him off, stood upon the threshold, gazing in
mute terror at the horror of her life, whispering incoherently,
“What is it, Hugh? How came he here? Save
me, save me from him!”</p>

<p class='c011'> A look, half of sorrow, half of contempt, flitted across
the stranger’s face as he answered for Hugh kindly, gently,
“Is the very sight of me so terrible to you, Eliza? Believe
me, you have nothing to fear. I am only here to
set matters right—to make amends for the past, so far as
possible. Here for our daughter’s sake.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He had drawn nearer to her as he said this last, but she
intuitively turned to Hugh, who started suddenly, growing
white and faint as a suspicion of the truth flashed upon
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mother?” he began, interrogatively, winding his arm
about her, for she was the weaker of the two.</p>

<p class='c011'>She knew what he would ask, and with her eye still upon
the man who fascinated her gaze, she answered, sadly,
“Forgive me, Hugh, I thought he was dead. The paper
said so, with all the particulars. Forgive me. He was—my
husband; he is—’Lina’s father, not yours, Hugh,
oh, Heaven be praised, not yours!” and she clung closely
to her boy, as if glad one child, at least, was not tainted
with the Murdoch blood.</p>

<p class='c011'>The convict smiled bitterly, and said to Hugh himself,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your mother is right. She was once my wife, but the
law set her free from the galling chain. I have had a
variety of names in my life; so many, indeed, that I hardly
knew which is my real one.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>He was perfectly cool, but his face showed the effort it
was to be so, while his black eyes rolled restlessly from
one object to another, and he was about to speak again
when Alice came tripping down the stairs, and pausing at
the parlor door, looked in.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Anna Richards!” she exclaimed, but uttered no other
sound for the terror of something terrible, which kept her
silent.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was no ordinary matter which had brought that group
together, and she stood looking from one to the other,
until the convict said,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Young lady, you cannot be the bride, but will you
call her, tell her she is wanted.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice never knew what she said to ’Lina. She was only
conscious of following her down the stairs and into that
dreadful room. Sullivan was watching for her, and the
muscles about his mouth twitched convulsively, while a shadow
of mingled pity and tenderness swept over his
features as his eye fell on the girlish figure behind her,
’Lina, with the orange blossoms in her hair—’Lina almost
ready for the bridal!</p>

<p class='c011'>For an instant the convict regarded her intently, and
there was something in his glance which brought Hugh
at once to ’Lina, where, with his arm upon her chair, he
stood as if he would protect her. Noble Hugh! ’Lina
never knew one-half how good and generous he was until
just as she was losing him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dr. Richards was restored by this time, and looked on
those around him in utter astonishment; on Mrs. Worthington
crouched in the farthest corner, her face as white
as ashes, and her eyes riveted upon the figure of the man
standing in the center of the room; on ’Lina, terrified
at what she saw; on Anna, more perplexed, more astonished
than himself, and on Hugh, towering up so commandingly
above the whole, and demanding of the convict the
explanation which he had come to make.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>There was a moment’s hesitancy, and his face flushed
and paled alternately ere the convict could summon courage
to begin.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Take this seat, sir, you need it,” Hugh said, bringing
him a chair and then resuming his watch over ’Lina, who
involuntarily leaned her throbbing head upon his arm,
and with the others listened to that strange tale of sin.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXIII.<br> <span class='large'>THE CONVICT’S STORY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“It is not an easy task to confess how bad one has been,”
the stranger said, “and once no power could have tempted
me to do it; but several years of prison life have
taught me some wholesome lessons, and I am not the same
man I was when I met you, Eliza, (bowing to Mrs.
Worthington) and won your hand if not your heart.
But previous to that time there was a passage of my life
which I must now repeat. At my boarding-house in
New York there was a young girl, a chamber-maid, whom
I deceived with promises of marriage and then deserted,
just when she needed me the most. I had found new
prey, was on the eve of marriage with Mrs. Eliza Worthington.
I—”</p>

<p class='c011'>The story was interrupted at this point by a cry from
’Lina, who moaned,</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, no, oh no! He is not <em>my</em> father; is he, Hugh?
Tell me no. John, Dr. Richards, pray look at me and
say it’s all a dream, a dreadful dream! Oh, Hugh!” and
to the brother, scorned so often, poor ’Lina turned for
sympathy, while the stranger continued,</p>

<p class='c011'>“It would be useless for me to say now that I loved
the girl, for I did not; but I felt sorry for her, and when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>six months after my marriage I heard that I was a father
I feigned an excuse and left my wife for a few weeks.
Eliza, you remember I said I had business in New York,
and so I had. I went to this young girl, finding her in a
low, wretched garret, with her baby in her arms, and a
look on her face which told me she had not long to live.
I staid by her till she died, promising to care for her
child and mine. I had a mother then, a woman, old and
infirm, and good, even if I was her son. To her I went in
my trouble, asking that she would care for the helpless
thing to which I gave the name Matilda. Mother
did not refuse, and leaving the baby in her charge I came
back to my lawful wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In course of time there was a daughter born to me
and to Eliza; a sweet brown-haired, brown-eyed girl,
whom we named <em>Adaline</em>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Instinctively, every one in that room glanced at the
black eyes and hair of ’Lina, marvelling at the change.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I loved this little girl, as it was natural I should,
more than I loved the other, and after she was born I
tried to be a better man, but could not hold out long,
and at last there came a separation. Eliza would not
live with me and I went away, but pined so for my child,
that I contrived to steal her, and carried her to my mother,
where was the other one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>’Lina’s eyes were dark as midnight, while she listened
breathlessly to this mysterious page of her existence.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My mother was very old and she died suddenly, leaving
me alone with my two girls. I could not attend to
them both, and so I sent one to Eliza, and kept the other
myself, hiring a housekeeper, and because it suited my
fancy, passing as Mr. Redfield, guardian to the little child,
whom I loved so much.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That was <em>Adah</em>,” fell in a whisper from the doctor’s
lips, but caught the ear of no one.</p>

<p class='c011'>All were too intent upon the story, which proceeded;</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>“She grew in beauty, and I was wondrous proud of
her, giving her every advantage in my power. I sent her
to the best of schools, and even looked forward to the day
when she should take the position she was so well fitted
to fill. After she was grown to girlhood we boarded, she
as the ward, I as the guardian still, and then one unlucky
day I stumbled upon <em>you, Dr. John</em>, but not until you first
had stumbled on my daughter, and been charmed with
her beauty, passing yourself as—as George Hastings,— lest
your fashionable associates should know how the
aristocratic Dr. Richards was in love with a poor, unknown
orphan, boarding up two flights of stairs.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who is he talking about, Hugh? Does he mean me?
My head throbs so, I don’t quite understand,” ’Lina said
piteously, while Hugh held the poor aching head against
his bosom, crushing the orange blossoms, and whispering
softly,</p>

<p class='c011'>“He means Adah.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Adah,” the convict rejoined. “John Richards
fancied Adah Gordon, as she was called, but loved his
pride and position more. I’ll do you justice, though,
young man, I believe at one time you really and truly
loved my child, and but for your mother’s letters might have
married her honorably. But you were afraid of that
mother. Your pride was stronger than your love; but I
was determined that you should have my daughter, and
proposed a mock marriage——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Monster! <em>You, her father</em>, planned that fiendish act!”
and Alice’s blue eyes flashed indignantly upon him, while
Hugh, forgetting that the idea was not new to him, walked
up before the “monster,” as if to lay him at his feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Listen, while I explain, and you will see the monster
had an object,” returned the stranger, speaking to Alice,
instead of Hugh. “It was the great wish of my heart that
my daughter should marry into a good family,—one which
would give her position, and when I saw how much John
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>Richards was pleased with her, I said <em>he</em> should be her
husband, for the Richards were known to me by reputation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“From what I knew of John I thought he would hardly
dare marry my daughter outright, and so I cautiously suggested
a mock marriage, saying, by way of excusing myself
that as I was only Adah’s guardian, I could not feel
towards her as a near relative would feel,—that, as I had
already expended large sums of money on her, I was getting
tired of it, and would be glad to be released, hinting,
by way of smoothing the fiendish proposition, my belief
that, from constant association, he would come to love her
so much that at last he would really and truly make her his
wife. He seemed shocked, and if I remember rightly, called
me a brute, and all that; but little by little I gained
ground, until at last he consented, stipulating that she
should not know his real name, which he knew I had discovered.
It seems strange that a father should wish his
child to marry one who would consent to act so base a
part, but I knew there was nothing unkind in the doctor’s
nature, and I trusted that his fondness for Adah and her
influence over him would bring it right at last.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I had an acquaintance, I said, who lived a few miles from
the city,—a man who, for money, would do any anything, and
who, as a feigned justice of the peace, would go through
with the ceremony, and ever after keep his own counsel.
I wonder the doctor himself did not make some inquiries
concerning this so called justice, but I think he is not
remarkably clear-headed, and this weakness saved me
much trouble. After a time I arranged the matter with my
friend, who was a lawful justice, staying at the house of
his brother, then absent in Europe. This being done, I
decided upon <em>Hugh Worthington</em>, for a witness, as being
the person of all the world, who should be present at the
bridal. He had recently come to New York, and I had accidentally
made his acquaintance, acquiring so strong an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>influence over him that when I invited him to the wedding
of my <em>ward</em>, he went unsuspectingly, signing his
name as witness and saluting the bride, who really was a
bride, as lawful a one as any who ever turned from the altar
where she had registered her vows.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, joy, joy!” and Alice sprang at once to her feet,
and hastening to the doctor’s side, said to him, authoritatively:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You hear, you understand, Adah is your wife, your
very own, and you must go back to her at once. You do
understand me?” and Alice grew very earnest as the
doctor failed to rouse up, as she thought he ought to do.</p>

<p class='c011'>Appealing next to Anna, she continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pray, make him comprehend that his wife is at Terrace
Hill.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Very gently Anna answered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“She was there, but she has gone. He knows it; I
came to tell him, but she fled immediately after recognizing
my brother, and left a letter revealing the whole.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It had come to ’Lina by this time that Dr. Richards
could never be her husband, and with a bitter cry, she
covered her face with her hands, and went shivering to
the corner where Mrs. Worthington sat, as if a mother’s
sympathy were needed now, and coveted as it had never
been before.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, mother,” she sobbed, laying her head in Mrs.
Worthington’s lap, “I wish I had never been born.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Sadly her wail of disappointment rang through the
room, and then the convict went on with his interrupted
narrative.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When the marriage was over, <em>Mr. Hastings</em> took his
wife to another part of the city, hiding her from his fashionable
associates, staying with her most of the time, and
appearing to love her so much that I thought it would not
be long before I should venture to tell him the truth. It
would be better to write it, I thought, and so I left her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>with him while I went South on—the very laudable
business of stealing negroes from one State and selling
them in another. At Cincinnati, I wrote to the doctor,
confessing the whole, but it seems my letter never reached
him, for, though I did not know it then, the car containing
that mail was burned, and my letter was burned
with it. Some of you know that I was caught in my
traffic, and that the negro stealer, Sullivan, was safely
lodged in prison, from which he was released but a day
since. Fearing there might be some mistake, I wrote from
my prison home to Adah herself, but suppose it did not
reach New York till after she had left it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A casual observer would have said that Mrs. Worthington
had heard less of that strange story than anyone else,
so motionless she sat, but not a word was missed by her in
the entire narrative, and when the narrator concluded,
she said anxiously,</p>

<p class='c011'>“And that child, the lawful wife of this young man, was
she mine, or was she the servant girl’s?”</p>

<p class='c011'>A little apart from the others, his arms folded tightly
together, and his eyes fixed upon the convict, stood
Hugh.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Answer her,” he said, gravely, as the convict did not
reply. “Tell her if Adah be her child, or,——<em>’Lina</em>,——which?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Had a clap of thunder cleft the air around her, ’Lina
could not have started up sooner than she did. It was
the <em>very first suspicion</em> which had crossed her brain, and
her life seemed dying out, as half way between Mrs. Worthington
and the convict she stood with hands outstretched
and livid lips, which tried to speak, but could only
moan convulsively. The convict took his eyes away from
<em>her</em>, pitying her so much, as he said, “<em>Adah</em> is my lawful
child. I kept her, and sent the other back. It was a bold
act, and I wonder it was not questioned, but Adaline’s eyes
were not so black then as they are now, and though five
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>months older than the other, she was small for her age,
and two years sometimes change a child materially; so
Eliza took it for granted that the girl she received as
Adaline, and whose real name was Matilda, was her own;
but Adah Hastings is <em>her</em> daughter and Hugh’s half sister
while this young woman is—the child of myself and the
servant girl.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice, Anna, and the doctor looked aghast, while Mrs.
Worthington murmured audibly, “Adah, darling Adah,
and Willie, precious Willie—oh, I want them here
now!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The mother had claimed her own, but alas, the fond
cry of welcome to sweet Adah Hastings was a death knell
to ’Lina, for it seemed to shut her out of that gentle woman’s
heart. There was no place for her, and in her terrible
desolation she stood alone, her eyes wandering wistfully
from one to another, but turning very quickly when
they fell on the convict, her father. She would not have
it so; she could not own a servant for her mother, that
villain for her father, and worse—oh, infinitely worse
than all—she had no right to be born! A child of sin
and shame, disgraced, disowned, forsaken. It was a terrible
blow, and the proud girl staggered beneath it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will no one speak to me?” she said, at last; “no one
break this dreadful silence? Has everybody forsaken me?
Do you all loathe and hate the offspring of such parents?
Won’t somebody pity and care for me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Yes, ’Lina</em>,” and <em>Hugh</em>—the one from whom she had
the least right to expect pity—Hugh came to her side;
and winding his arm around her, said, with a choking
voice, “<em>I</em> will not forsake you, ’Lina; I will care for you
the same as ever, and so long as I have a home you shall
have one too.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Hugh, I don’t deserve this from you!” was ’Lina’s
faint response, as she laid her head upon his bosom, whispering,
“Take me away—from them all—up stairs—on
the bed! I am so sick, and my head is bursting open!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>Hugh was strong as a young giant, and lifting gently
the yielding form, he bore it from the room—the bridal
room, which she would never enter again, until he brought
her back—and laid her softly down beneath the windows,
dropping tears upon her white, still face, and whispering,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor ’Lina!”</p>

<p class='c011'>As Hugh passed out with his burden in his arms, the
bewildered company seemed to rally; but the convict was
the first to act. Turning to Mrs. Worthington, still shivering
in the corner, he said,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Eliza, you see I did <em>not</em> die as that paper told you,
but it suited me then to be <em>dead</em>, and so I wrote the paragraph
myself, sending you the paper. For this you
should thank me, as it made a few years of your life happier,
thinking I was dead. I have come here to-night for
my children’s sake; and now that I have done what I
came to do, I shall leave you, only asking that you continue
to be a mother to the poor girl who is really the
only sufferer. The rest have cause for joy; you in particular,”
turning to the doctor. “But tell me again what
was that I heard of Adah’s having fled?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna repeated the story, and then conquering her repugnance
of the man, asked if he would not immediately
seek for her and bring her back if possible.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My brother will help you,” she said, “when he recovers
himself,” and she turned to the doctor, who suddenly seemed
to break the spell which had bound him, and springing
to his feet, exclaimed,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Lily shall be found, but I must see my boy first.
Anna, can’t we go now, to-night?”</p>

<p class='c011'>That was impossible; Anna was too tired, Alice said,
and conducting her to her own room, she made her take
the rest she so much needed.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Alice returned again to the parlor, the convict
had gone. There had been a short consultation between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>himself and the doctor, an engagement to meet in Cincinnati
to arrange their plan of search; and then he had turned
again to his once wife, still sitting in her corner, motionless,
white, and paralyzed with nervous terror.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You need not fear me, Eliza,” he said, kindly; “I shall
probably never trouble you again; and though you have
no cause to believe my word, I tell you solemnly that I
will never rest until I have found our daughter, and sent
her back to you. Good-bye, Eliza, good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He did not offer her his hand; he knew she would not
touch it; but with one farewell look of contrition and regret,
he left her, and mounting the horse which had brought
him there, dashed away from Spring Bank, just as Colonel
Tiffton reined up to the gate.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was Alice who met him in the hall, explaining to
him as much as she thought necessary, and asking him, on
his return, to wait a little by the field gate, and turn back
other guests who might be on the road.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Colonel promised compliance with her request, and
as only a few had been invited, it was not a hard task imposed
upon him. ’Lina had been taken very sick, was all
the excuse the discreet Colonel would give to the people,
who rather reluctantly turned their faces homeward, so
that Spring Bank was not honored with wedding guests
that night; and when the clock struck eight, the appointed
hour for the bridal, only the bridegroom sat in the
dreary parlor, his head bent down upon the sofa arm, and
his chest heaving with the sobs he could not repress as he
thought of all poor Lily had suffered since he left her so
cruelly. Hugh had told him what he did not understand
before. He had come into the room for his mother, whom
’Lina was pleading to see; and after leading her to the
chamber of the half-delirious girl, he had returned to the
doctor, and related to him all he knew of Adah, dwelling
long upon her gentleness and beauty, which had won from
him a brother’s love, even though he knew not she was
his sister.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>“I was a wretch, a villain!” the doctor groaned. Then
looking wistfully at Hugh, he said, “Do you think she
loves me still? Listen to what she says in her farewell
to Anna,” and with faltering voice, he read: “That killed
the love; and now, if I could, I would not be his except
for Willie’s sake. Do you think she meant it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have no doubt of it, sir. How could her love out
live everything? Curses and blows might not have killed
it, but when you thought to ruin her good name, to deny
your child, she would be less than woman could she forgive.
Why, I hate and despise you myself for the wrong
you have done <em>my sister</em>,” and Hugh’s tall form seemed
to take on an increased height as he abruptly left the
room, lest his hot temper should get the mastery, and he
knock-down his dastardly brother-in-law.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a sad house at Spring Bank that night, where
’Lina lay, tossing distractedly from side to side; now
holding her throbbing head, and now thrusting out her
hot, dry hands, as if to keep off some fancied form, who
claimed to be her mother.</p>

<p class='c011'>The shock had been a terrible one to ’Lina. She did
love Dr. Richards; and the losing him was enough of itself
to drive her mad; but worse even than this, and far
more humiliating to her pride, was the discovery of her
parentage, the knowing that a convict was her father, a
common servant her mother, and that no marriage tie had
hallowed her birth.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I can’t bear it!” she cried. “I can’t. I wish I
might die! Will nobody kill me? Hugh, you will, I
know!”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Hugh was away for the family physician, for he would
not trust a gossipping servant to do the errand. Once before
that doctor had stood by ’Lina’s bedside, and felt her
feverish pulse, but his face then was not as anxious as now,
when he counted the rapidly increasing beats, and saw
how fast the fever came on. There had been an exposure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>to cold, he said, sufficient of itself to induce a fever, but
the whole had been aggravated a hundred fold by the late
disastrous affair, of which Hugh had told him something.
He did not speak of danger, but Hugh, who watched
him narrowly, read it in his face, and following him down
the stairs, asked to be told the truth.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is going to be very sick. She may get well, but
I have little to hope from symptoms like hers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>That was the doctor’s reply, and with a sigh Hugh
went back to the sick girl, who had given him little else
than sarcasm and scorn.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXIV.<br> <span class='large'>POOR ’LINA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Drearily the morning dawned, but there were no bridal
slumbers to be broken, no bridal farewells said. There
were indeed good-byes to be spoken, for Anna was impatient
to be gone, and at an early hour she was ready to
leave the house she had entered under so unpleasant circumstances.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would like to see ’Lina,” she said to Alice, who carried
the request to the sick room.</p>

<p class='c011'>But ’Lina refused. “I can’t,” she said; “she hates, she
despises me, and she had reason. Tell her I was not worthy
to be her sister; tell her anything you like; but the
doctor—oh, Alice, do you think he’ll come, just for a minute,
before he goes?”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not a pleasant thing for the doctor to meet ’Lina
now face to face, for he thought she wished to reproach him
for his treachery. But she did not—she thought only of
herself; and when at last, urged on by Anna and Alice,
he entered in to her presence, she only offered him her
hand at first without a single word. He was shocked to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>find her so sick, for a few hours had worked a marvellous
change in her, and he shrank from the bright eyes fixed
so eagerly on his face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Dr. Richards,” she began at last, “if I loved you
less it would not be so hard to tell you what I must. I
did love you, bad as I am, but I meant to deceive you.
It was for me that Adah kept silence at Terrace Hill.
Adah, I almost hate her for having crossed my path.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a fearfully vindictive gleam in the bright
eyes now, and the doctor shudderingly looked away, while
’Lina, with a softer tone continued, “You believed me rich,
and whether you loved me afterward or not, you sought
me first for my money. I kept up the delusion, for in no
other way could I have won you. Dr. Richards, if I die,
as perhaps I may, I shall have one less sin for which to
atone, if I confess to you that instead of the heiress you
imagined me to be, I had scarcely money enough to pay
my board at that hotel. Hugh, who himself is poor, furnished
what means I had, and most of my jewelry was
borrowed. Do you hear that? Do you know what you
have escaped?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She almost shrieked at the last, for she read his feelings
in his face, and knew that he despised her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Go,” she continued, “find your Adah. It’s nothing
but Adah now. I see her name in everything. Hugh
thinks of nothing else, and why should he? She’s his sister,
and <em>I</em>—oh! I’m nobody but a beggarly servant’s brat.
I wish I was dead! I wish I was dead, and I will be
pretty soon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was their parting, and the doctor left her room a
sobered, sadder man than he had entered it. Half an hour
later, and he, with Anna, was fast nearing Versailles, where
they were joined by Mr. Millbrook, and together the three
started on their homeward route.</p>

<hr class='c014'>

<p class='c011'>Rapidly the tidings flew, told in a thousand different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>ways, and the neighborhood was all on fire with the
strange gossip. But little cared they at Spring Bank for
the storm outside. So fierce a one was beating at their
doors, that even the fall of Sumter failed to elicit more
than a casual remark from Hugh, who read without the
slightest emotion the President’s call for 75,000 men. At
another time he might have been eager to join the fray
and hasten to avenge the insult, for Kentucky held no
truer patriot than he, but now all his thoughts were centered
in that dark room where ’Lina raved in mad delirium,
controlled only by his or Alice’s voice, and quiet
only when one of them was with her. Tenderer than a
brother was Hugh to the raving creature, staying by her
so patiently and uncomplainingly that none save Alice
ever guessed how he longed to be free and join in the
search for Adah, which had as yet proved fruitless. Night
after night, day after day, ’Lina grew worse, until at last
there was no hope, and the council of physicians summoned
to her side, said that she would die. Still she lingered
on, and the fever abated at last, the eyes were not so fearfully
bright, while the wild ravings were hushed, and ’Lina
lay quietly upon her pillow.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you know me?” Alice asked, bending gently over
her, while Hugh, from the other side of the bed, leaned
eagerly forward for the reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, but where am I? This is not New York.
Have I—am I sick, very sick?” and ’Lina’s eyes took a
terrified expression as she read the truth in Alice’s face.
“I am not going to <em>die</em>, am I?” she continued, casting
upon Alice a look which would have wrung out the
truth, even if Alice had been disposed to withhold it,
which she was not.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are very sick,” she answered, “and though we
hope for the best, the doctor does not encourage us much.
Are you willing to die, ’Lina?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Neither Hugh nor Alice ever forgot the tone of ’Lina’s
voice as she replied,</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>“Willing? <em>No!</em>” or the expression of her face, as she
turned it to the wall, and motioned them to leave her.</p>

<p class='c011'>For two days after that she neither spoke nor gave
other token of interest in any thing passing around her,
but at the expiration of that time, as Alice sat by her, she
suddenly exclaimed,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who
trespass against us. I wish he had said that some other
way, for if that means we can not be forgiven until we forgive
every body, there’s no hope for me, for I cannot, <em>I will
not</em> forgive that servant for being my mother, neither will
I forgive Adah Hastings for having crossed my path. If
she had never seen the doctor I should have been his
wife, and never have know who or what I was. I hate
them both, so you need not pray for me. I heard you last
night, but it’s no use. I can’t forgive.”</p>

<p class='c011'>’Lina was very much excited—so much so, indeed, that
Alice could not talk with her then; and for days this was
the burden of her remarks. She could not forgive her mother
nor Adah, and until she did, there was no use for her or
any one else to pray. But the prayers she could not say
for herself were said for her by others, while Alice omitted
no proper occasion for talking with her personally on the
subject she felt to be all important. Nor were these efforts
without their effect, for the bitter tone ceased at last,
and ’Lina became gentle as a child.</p>

<p class='c011'>Taking Mrs. Worthington’s hand one day, she said,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ve given you little cause to love me, and I know
how glad you must be that another, and not I, is your
real daughter. I did not know what made me so bad, but
I understand it now. I saw myself so plainly in that
man’s eyes; it was his nature in me which made me a
second Satan—so bad to you, so hateful to Hugh. Oh,
Hugh! the memory of what I’ve been to him is the hardest
part of all, for I want him to think kindly of me when
I’m gone!” and covering her face with the sheet, ’Lina
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>wept bitterly; while Hugh, who was standing behind her
laid his warm hand on her head, smoothing her hair
caressingly, as he said,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never mind that, ’Lina; I, too, was bad to you—provoking
you purposely many times, and exposing your
weakness just to see how savage you would be. If ’Lina
can forgive <em>me</em>, I surely can forgive ’Lina.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was the sound of convulsive sobbing; and then,
uncovering her face, ’Lina raised herself up, and laying
her head on Hugh’s bosom, answered through her
tears,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish I had always felt as I do now. We should
have been happier together, and it would not be so great
a relief to you’all to have me gone, never to come back
again. Hugh, you don’t know how bad I’ve been. You
remember the money you sent to Adah last summer in
mother’s letter. I kept the whole. I burned the letter,
and mother never saw it. I bought jewelry with Adah’s
money. I did so many things, I—I—it goes from me
now. I can’t remember all. Oh, must I confess the whole,
everything, before I can say, ‘Forgive us our trespasses?’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, ’Lina. Unless you can repair some wrong, you are
not bound to tell every little thing. Confession is due to
God alone,” Alice whispered to the agitated girl, who looked
bewildered, as she answered back, “But God knows all now,
and you do not; besides, I can’t feel sorry towards Him as
I do towards others. I try and try, but the feeling is not
there—the sorry feeling, I mean, as sorry as I want to
feel.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“God, who knows our feebleness, accepts our purpose
to do better, and gives us strength to carry them out,”
Alice whispered, again bending over ’Lina, on whose
pallid, distressed face a ray of hope for a moment shone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have good purposes,” she murmured, “but I can’t, I
can’t. I don’t know as they are real; may be, if I get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>well, they would not last, and it’s all so dark, so desolate,—nothing
to make life desirable,—no home, no name, no
friends—and death is so terrible. Oh, Hugh, Hugh!
don’t let me go. You are strong; you can hold me back,
even from Death himself, and I can be good to you; I can
feel on that point, and I tell you truly that, standing as I
am with the world behind and death before, I see nothing
to make life desirable, but you, Hugh, my noble, my abused
brother. To make you love me, as I hope I might, is
worth living for. You would stand by me, Hugh,—you
if no one else, and I wish I could tell you how fast the
great throbs of love keep coming to my heart. Dear
Hugh, brother Hugh, don’t let me die,—hold me fast.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With an icy shiver, she clung closer to Hugh, as if he
could indeed do battle with the king of terrors stealing
slowly into that room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Somebody say ‘Our Father,’” she whispered, “I can’t
remember how it goes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you forgive and love everybody?” Alice asked,
sighing as she saw the bitter expression flash for an instant
over the pinched features, while the white lips answered,
“Not Adah, no, not Adah.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice could not pray after that, not aloud at least, and
a deep silence fell upon the group assembled around the
death-bed, while ’Lina slept quietly on Hugh’s strong
arm. Gradually the hard expression on the face relaxed,
giving way to one of quiet peace, as they waited anxiously
for the close of that long sleep. It was broken at last,
but ’Lina seemed lost to all save the thoughts burning at her
breast,—thoughts which brought a quiver to her lips, and
forced out upon her brow great drops of sweat. The noonday
sun of May was shining broadly into the room, but to
’Lina it was night, and she said to Alice, now kneeling at
her side, “It’s growing dark; they’ll light the street
lamps pretty soon, and the band will play in the yard, but
I shall not hear them. New York and Saratoga are a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>great ways off, and so is Terrace Hill. Tell Adah I <em>do</em>
forgive her, and I would like to see her, for she is my half
sister. The bitter is all gone. I am in charity with everybody,
everybody. May I say ‘Our Father’ now? It
goes and comes, goes and comes, forgive our trespasses,
my trespasses; how is it, Hugh? Say it with me once,
and you, too, mother.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Worthington, with a low cry began with Hugh
the soothing prayer in which ’Lina joined feebly, throwing
in ejaculatory sentences of her own. “Forgive my
trespasses as I forgive those that trespass against me.
Bless Hugh, dear Hugh, noble Hugh. Forgive us our
trespasses, forgive us our trespasses, our trespasses, forgive
<em>my</em> trespasses, <em>me</em>, forgive, forgive.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the last words which ever passed ’Lina’s lips,
“Forgive, forgive,” and Hugh, with his ear close to the
lips, heard the faint murmur even after the hands had fallen
from his neck where, in the last struggle, they had been
clasped, and after the look which comes but once to
all had settled on her face. That was the last of ’Lina,
with that cry for pardon she passed away, and though it
was but a death-bed repentance, and she, the departed,
had much need for pardon, Alice clung to it as to a ray of
hope, knowing how tender and full of compassion was the
blessed Saviour, even to those who turn not to him until
the river of death is bearing them away. Very gently
Hugh laid the dead girl back upon the pillow, and leaving
one kiss on her white forehead, hurried away to his own
room, where, unseen by mortal eye, he could ask for knowledge
to give himself to the God who had come so near to
them.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next day was appointed for the funeral, and just as
the sun was setting, a long procession wound across the
fields, and out to the hillside, where the Spring Bank dead
were buried, and where they laid ’Lina to rest, forgetting
all her faults, and speaking only kindly words of her as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>they went slowly back to the house, from which she had
gone forever.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXV.<br> <span class='large'>JOINING THE ARMY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Ten days after the burial, there came three letters to
Spring Bank, one to Hugh, from Murdoch, as he now
chose to be called, saying that though he had sought and
was still searching for the missing Adah, he could only
trace her, and that but vaguely, to the Greenbush depot,
where he lost sight of her entirely, no one after that having
seen a person bearing the least resemblance to her.
After a consultation with the doctor, he had advertised
for her, and he enclosed a copy of the advertisement, as
it appeared in the different papers of Boston, Albany, and
New York.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If A—— H—— will let her whereabouts be known to her friends,
she will hear of something to her advantage.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was the purport of Murdoch’s letter, if we except
a kind enquiry after <em>’Lina</em>, of whose death he had not
heard.</p>

<p class='c011'>The second, for Alice, was from Anna Richards, who
having heard of ’Lina’s decease, spoke kindly of the unfortunate
girl, and then wrote. “I have great hopes of
my erring brother, now that I know how his whole heart
goes out towards his beautiful boy, our darling Willie. I
wish poor, dear Lily could have seen him when, on his arrival
at Terrace Hill, he knelt by the crib of his sleeping
child, waking him at once, and hugging him to his bosom,
while his tears dropped like rain. I am sure she would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>have chosen to be his wife, for her own sake as well as
Willie’s.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You knew how proud my mother and sisters are, and
it would surprise you to see them pet, and spoil, and fondle
Willie, who rules the entire household; mother even allowing
him to bring wheel-barrow, drum, and trumpet
into the parlor, declaring that she likes the noise, as it
stirs up her blood. Willie has made a vast change in our
once quiet home, and I fear I shall meet with much opposition
when I take him away, as I expect to do next
month, for Lily gave him to me, and brother John has
said that I may have him until the mother is found, while
Charlie is perfectly willing; and thus, you see, my cup of
joy is full.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Brother is away now, searching for Adah, and I am
wicked enough not to miss him, so busy am I in the few
preparations needed by the wife of a poor missionary.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, in a postscript, Anna added: “I forgot to tell you
that Charlie and I are to be married some time in July,
that the Presbyterian Society of Snowdon have given him
a call to be their pastor, that he has accepted, and what
is best of all, has actually rented your old home for us to
live in. Oh, I am so happy; I do not feel like an old
maid of thirty-three, and Charlie flatters me by saying I
have certainly gone back in looks to twenty. Perhaps I
have, but it all comes of happiness and a heart full of
thankfulness to our good Father who has so greatly blessed
me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With a smile, Alice finished the childlike letter, so much
like Anna. Then feeling that Mrs. Worthington would be
glad to hear from Willie, she went in quest of her, finding
her at the end of the long piazza, listening while Hugh
read the sympathetic letter received from Irving Stanley.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the doctor, whom he accidentally met on Broadway,
Irving had heard of ’Lina’s death, and he wrote at
once to Mrs. Worthington, expressing his sympathy for her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>own and Hugh’s bereavement; thus showing that the Dr.
had only told him a part of the sad story, withholding
all that concerned Adah, who was evidently a stranger to
Irving Stanley. His sister, Mrs. Ellsworth, was well, he
wrote, though very busy with her preparations for going
to Europe, whither he intended accompanying her, adding
“it was not so much pleasure which was taking her there,
as the hope that by some of the Paris physicians her
little deformed Jennie might be benefitted. She had
secured a gem of a governess for her daughter, a young
lady whom he had not yet seen, but over whose beauty
and accomplishments his staid sister Carrie had really
waxed eloquent.” The letter closed by asking if Hugh
were still at home or had he joined the army.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh-h,” and Alice’s cheek grew pale at the very idea of
Hugh’s putting himself in so much danger, for Hugh was
very dear to her now. His noble, unselfish devotion to
’Lina had finished the work begun on that memorable
night when she had said to him, “I may learn to love
you,” and more than once as she watched with him by
’Lina’s bedside, she had been tempted to wind her arm
around his neck and whisper in his ear,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hugh, I love you now, I will be your wife.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But propriety had held her back and made her far more
reserved towards him than she had ever been before.
Terribly jealous where she was concerned, Hugh was
quick to notice the change, and the gloomy shadow on his
face was not caused wholly by ’Lina’s sad death, as many
had supposed. Hugh was very unhappy. Instead of
learning to love him, as he had sometimes hoped she might,
Alice had come to dislike him, shunning his society, and always
making some pretense to get away if by chance they
were left alone, or if compelled to talk with him, chatting
rapidly on the most indifferent topics. She never would
love him, Hugh thought, and feeling that the sooner he
left home the better, he had decided to start at once in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>quest of Adah. This decision he had not yet communicated
to his mother, but as the closing of Irving Stanley’s
letter seemed to open the way, he rather abruptly announced
his intention of going immediately to New York.
He did not however add that failing to find his sister, he
might possibly join the Federal Army.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ever since he had had time to think clearly upon the
subject then agitating the public mind, Hugh had felt an
intense desire to enroll himself with the patriotic men
who would not sit idly down while their country was laying
her dishonored head low in the dust. A Unionist to
the heart’s core, he had already won some notoriety by
his bitter denunciations against those men who, with
Harney at their head, were advocating secession from the
union. But his first duty was to Adah, and so he only
talked of her and the probabilities of his finding her.
He should start to-morrow, if possible, he said. He had
made his arrangements to do so, and there was no longer
an excuse for tarrying. They would get on well enough
without him; they would not miss him much, and he
stole a glance at Alice, who, fearful lest she might betray
herself, framed some excuse for leaving her seat upon the
piazza, and stole up to her room where she could be alone,
to think how desolate Spring Bank would be when Hugh
was really gone.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once she thought to tell him all, thinking that a perfect
understanding would make her so much happier
while he was away, but maidenly modesty kept her back,
and so the words which would have brought so much
comfort to Hugh were to the last unspoken. Gentler,
kinder, tenderer than a sister’s could have been, was her
demeanor towards him during the whole of the next day,
the last he spent at home. Once, emboldened by something
she said, Hugh felt half tempted to sue again for
the love so coveted, but depreciation of himself kept him
silent, and when at last they parted, his manner towards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>her was so constrained and cold that even Mrs. Worthington
observed it, wondering what had come between
them. She wanted Alice to think well of Hugh, and by
way of obliterating any unpleasant impression he might
have left in her mind, she spent the morning after
his departure in talking of him, telling how kind he had
always been to her, and how kind he was to every body.
Many acts were enumerated by the fond mother as proofs
of his unselfishness, and among others she spoke of his
heroic conduct years ago, when with his uncle he was on
Lake Erie and the boat took fire. Had she never told
Alice?</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, never,” Alice answered faintly, a new light breaking
in upon her and showing her why it was that Hugh’s
face had so often puzzled her.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>He</em> was the boy to whose care she had entrusted her
life, and <em>she</em> was the <em>Golden Haired</em>, remembered by him
so long and so lovingly. There was one great throb of
joy,—of perfect delight, and then an intense desire to
tell Hugh of her discovery——.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Hugh was gone, and her only alternative now
was to write. He was intending to stop two days in
Cincinnati, and he had said to his mother, “If any thing
happens you can write to me there,” and something had
happened, something which made her heart throb wildly,
as alone in her room she knelt and thanked her God, asking
that he would care for the Hugh so dear to her, and bring
him safely back.</p>

<p class='c011'>Two days later and Hugh, who had but an hour longer
to remain in Cincinnati, sauntered to the post-office, with
very little expectations that he should find any thing
awaiting him. How then was he surprised when a clerk
handed him Alice’s letter, the sixth she had written ere at
all satisfied with its wording. Hurrying back to his room
at the hotel, he broke the seal, and read as follows.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>“<span class='sc'>Dear Hugh</span>:—I have at last discovered <em>who</em> you are,
and why I have so often been puzzled with your face.
You are the boy whom I met on the St. Helena, and
who rescued me from drowning. Why have you never
told me this?</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dear Hugh, I wish I had known it earlier. It seems so
cold, thanking you on paper, but I have no other opportunity,
and must do it here.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We were both unconscious when taken from the water,
but you were holding fast to my arm, and so really
was the means of my being saved, though a fisherman
carried me to the shore. You must have been removed
at once, for when we inquired for you we could only learn
that you were gone. Heaven bless you, Hugh. My
mother prayed often for the preserver of her child, and
need I tell you that I, too, shall never forget to pray for
you? The Lord keep you in all your ways, and lead you
safely to your sister,</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Alice</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Many times Hugh read this note, then pressing it to his
lips thrust it into his bosom, but failed to see what Alice
had hoped he might see, that the love he once asked for
was his at last.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If she loved me, she would have told me so,” he
thought, “for she promised me as much, but she does not,
so that ends the drama. Oh, Golden Hair, why <em>did</em> I ever
meet her, or why was I suffered to love her so devotedly,
if I must lose her at the last!”</p>

<p class='c011'>There were great drops of sweat about Hugh’s lips,
and on his forehead, as, burying his face in his hands, he
laid both upon the table, and battled manfully with his
love for Alice Johnson.</p>

<p class='c011'>“God help me in my sorrow,” was the prayer which
fell from the quivering lips, but did not break the silence
of that little room, where none, save God, witnessed
the conflict, the last Hugh ever fought for Alice Johnson.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>He <em>could</em> give her up at length; could think, without
a shudder, of living all his life without her, and when,
late that afternoon, he took the evening train for Cleveland,
not one in the crowded car would have guessed how
sore was the heart of the young man who plunged so energetically
into the spirited war argument in progress between
a Northern and Southern politician. It was a
splendid escape-valve for his pent up feelings, and Hugh
carried everything before him, taking by turns both sides
of the question, and effectually silencing the two combatants,
who said to each other in parting, “We shall
hear from that Kentuckian again, though whether in
Rebeldom or Yankee land we cannot tell.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Arrived at New York he wrote a reply to Alice’s note,
saying that what he had done for her was no more than
he ought to have done for any one who had come to him
for help, and that she need not expend her gratitude on
him, though he was glad of any thing to keep him in her
remembrance.</p>

<p class='c011'>After this he wrote regularly, kind, friendly letters, and
Alice was beginning to feel that they in some degree
atoned for his absence, when there came one which
wrung a wailing cry from Mrs. Worthington, and brought
Alice at once to her side.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is it?” she asked in much alarm, and Mrs.
Worthington replied, “Oh, Hugh, my boy! he’s enlisted,
joined the army! I shall never see him again!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Could Hugh have seen Alice then, he would not for a
moment have doubted the nature of her feelings towards
himself. She did not cry out, nor faint, but her face turned
white as the dress she wore, while her hands pressed
so tightly together, that her nails left the impress in her
flesh.</p>

<p class='c011'>“God keep him from danger and death,” she murmured;
then, winding her arm around the stricken mother,
she wiped her tears away; and to her moaning cry that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>she was left alone, replied, “Let me be your child till he
returns, or, if he never does——”</p>

<p class='c011'>She could get no further, and sinking down beside
Hugh’s mother, she laid her head on her lap, and wept
bitterly. Alas, that scenes like this should be so common
in our once happy land, but so it is. Mothers start with
terror, and grow faint over the boy just enlisted for the
war; then follow him with prayers and yearning love to
the distant battle field; then wait and watch for tidings
from him; and then too often read with streaming eyes
and hearts swelling with agony, the fatal message which
says <em>their boy is dead</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a sad day at Spring Bank when first the news
of Hugh’s enlistment came, for Hugh seemed as really
dead as if they heard the hissing shell or whizzing ball
which was to bear his young life away. It was nearly
two months since he left home, and he could find no trace
of Adah, though searching faithfully for her, in conjunction
with Murdoch and Dr. Richards, both of whom had
joined him in New York.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If Murdoch cannot find her,” he wrote, “I am convinced
no one can, and I leave the matter now to him,
feeling that another duty calls me, the duty of fighting
for my country.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was just after the disastrous battle of Bull Run, when
people were wild with excitement, and Hugh was thus
borne with the tide, until he found himself enrolled as a
private in a regiment of cavalry, gathering in one of the
Northern States. There had been an instant’s hesitation,
a clinging of the heart to the dear old home at Spring
Bank, where his mother and Alice were; and then, with
an eagerness which made his whole frame tremble, he had
seized the pen, and written down his name, amid deafening
cheers for the brave Kentuckian. This done, there
was no turning back; nor did he desire it. It seemed as
if he were made for war, so eagerly he longed to join the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>fray. Only one thing was wanting, and that was <em>Rocket</em>.
He had tried the “Yankee horses,” as he called them, but
found them far inferior to his pet. Rocket, he must have,
and in his letter to his mother, he made arrangements for
her to send him northward by a Versailles merchant, who
he knew, was coming to New York.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hugh and Rocket, they would make a splendid match,
and so Alice thought, as, on the day when Rocket was led
away, she stood with her arms around his graceful neck,
whispering to him the words of love she would fain have
sent his master. She had recovered from the first shock
of Hugh’s enlistment. She could think of him now
calmly as a soldier; could pray that God would keep him,
and even feel a throb of pride that one who had lived so
many years in Kentucky, then poising almost equally in
the scale, should come out so bravely for the right, though
by that act he called down curses on his head from those
at home who favored Rebellion, and who, if they fought
at all, would cast in their lot with the seceding States.
She had written to Hugh telling him how proud she was
of him, and how her sympathy and prayers would follow
him everywhere. “And if,” she had added, in concluding,
“you are sick, or wounded, I will come to you as a sister
might do. I will find you wherever you are.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She had sent this letter to him three weeks before, and
now she stood caressing the beautiful Rocket, who sometimes
proudly arched his long neck, and then looked
wistfully at the sad group gathered round him, as if he
knew it was no ordinary parting. Col. Tiffton, who had
heard what was going on, had ridden over to expostulate
with Mrs. Worthington against sending Rocket North.
“Better keep him at home,” he said, “and tell Hugh to
come back, and let those who had raised the muss settle
their own difficulty.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The old colonel, who was a native of Virginia, did not
know exactly where he stood. “He was very patriotic,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>he said, “but hanged if he knew which side to take—both
were wrong. He didn’t go Nell’s doctrine, for Nell was a
<em>rabid Secesh</em>; neither did he swallow Abe Lincoln, and
he’d advise Alice to keep a little more quiet, for there
was no knowing what the hot heads would do; they
might pounce on Spring Bank any night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let them,” and Alice’s blue eyes flashed brightly
while her girlish figure seemed to expand and grow higher
as she continued; “they will find no cowards here. I
never touched a revolver in my life. I am quite as much
afraid of one that is not loaded as of one that is, but I’ll
conquer the weakness. I’ll begin to-day. I’ll learn to
handle fire-arms. I’ll practice shooting at a mark, and if
Hugh is killed I’ll——”</p>

<p class='c011'>She could not tell what she would do, for the woman
conquered all other feelings, and laying her face on Rocket’s
silken mane, she sobbed aloud.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There’s pluck, by George!” muttered the old colonel.
“I most wish Nell was that way of thinking.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was time now for Rocket to go, and ‘mid the deafening
howls of the negroes and the tears of Mrs. Worthington
and Alice he was led away, the latter watching
him until he was lost to sight beyond the distant hill, then
falling on her knees she prayed, as many a one has done,
that God would be with our brave soldiers, giving them
the victory, and keeping <em>one</em> of them, at least, from falling.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sadly, gloomily the autumn days came on, and the land
was rife with war and rumors of war. In the vicinity of
Spring Bank were many patriots, but there were hot
Secessionists there also, and bitter contentions ensued.
Old friends were estranged, families were divided, neighbors
watched each other jealously, while all seemed
waiting anxiously for the result.</p>

<p class='c011'>Blacker, and darker, and thicker the war clouds gathered
on our horizon, but our story has little to do with that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>first year of carnage, when human blood was poured as
freely as water, from the Cumberland to the Potomac.
Over all that we pass, and open the scene again in the
summer of ‘62, when people were gradually waking to
the fact that Richmond was <em>not</em> so easily taken, or the
South so easily conquered.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXVI.<br> <span class='large'>THE DESERTER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>There had been a desertion from a regiment on the
Potomac. An officer of inferior rank, but whose position
had been such as to make him the possessor of much
valuable information, was missing from his command one
morning, and under such circumstances as to leave little
doubt that his intention was to reach the enemy’s lines if
possible. Long and loud were the invectives against the
traitor, and none were deeper in their denunciations
than Captain Hugh Worthington, as, seated on his fiery
war-horse, Rocket, he heard from Irving Stanley the story
of <em>Dr. Richards’</em> disgrace.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He should be pursued, brought back, and shot!” he
said, emphatically, feeling that he would like much to be
one of the pursuers already on the track of the treacherous
doctor, who skillfully eluded them all, and just at
the close of a warm summer day, sat in the shadow of
the Virginia woods, weary, foot-sore and faint with the
pain caused from his ankle, sprained by a recent fall.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had hunted for Adah until entirely discouraged,
and partly as a panacea for the remorse preying so constantly
upon him, and partly in compliance with Anna’s
entreaties, he had at last joined the Federal army, and
been sworn in with the full expectation of some lucrative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>office. But his unlucky star was in the ascendant. Stories
derogatory to his character were set afloat, and the
final result of the whole was that he found himself enrolled
in a company where he knew he was disliked, and under
a captain whom he thoroughly detested, for the fraud
practised upon himself. In this condition he was sent to
the Potomac, and while on duty as a picket, grew to be
on the most friendly terms with more than one of the
enemy, planning at last to desert, and effecting his escape
one stormy night, when the watch were off their guard.
Owing to some mistake, the aid promised by his Rebel
friends had not been extended, and as best he could he
was making his way to Richmond, when, worn out with
hunger and fatigue, he sank down to die, as he believed,
at the entrance of some beautiful woods which skirted the
borders of a well kept farm in Virginia. Before him, at
the distance of nearly a quarter of a mile, a large, handsome
house was visible, and by the wreath of smoke curling
from the rear chimney, he knew it was inhabited, and
thought once to go there, and beg for the food he craved
so terribly. But fear kept him back—the people might
be Unionists, and might detain him a prisoner until the
officers upon his track came up. Dr. Richards was cowardly,
and so with a groan, he laid his head upon the
grass, and half wished that he had died ere he came to be
the miserable wretch he was. The pain in his ankle was
by this time intolerable, and the limb was swelling so fast
that to walk on the morrow was impossible, and if he
found a shelter at all, it must be found that night.</p>

<p class='c011'>Midway between himself and the house was a comfortable
looking barn, whither he resolved to go. But the
journey was a tedious one, and brought to his flushed
forehead great drops of sweat wrung out by the agony
it caused him to step upon his foot. At last, when he
could bear his weight upon it no longer, he sank upon
the ground, and crawling slowly upon his hands and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>knees, reached the barn just as it was growing dark, and
the shadows creeping into the corners made him half
shrink with terror, lest they were the bayonets of those
whose coming he was constantly expecting. He could
not climb to the scaffolding, and so he sought a friendly
pile of hay, and crouching down behind it, fell asleep for
the first time in three long days and nights.</p>

<p class='c011'>The early June sun was just shining through the cracks
between the boards when he awoke: sore, stiff, feverish,
burning with thirst, and utterly unable to use the poor,
swollen foot, which lay so helplessly upon the hay.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, for Anna now,” he moaned; “if she were only
here; or Lily, she <em>would</em> pity and forgive, could she see me
now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But hark, what sound is it which falls upon his ear,
making him quake with fear, and, in spite of his aching
ankle, creep farther behind the hay! It is a footstep—a
light, tripping step, and it comes that way, nearer, nearer,
until a shadow falls between the open chinks and the
bright sunshine without. Then it moves on, round the
corner, pausing for a moment, while the hidden coward
holds his breath and listens anxiously, hoping nothing is
coming there. But there is, and it enters the same door
through which he came the previous night—a girlish
figure, with a basket on its arm—a basket in which she
puts the eggs she knew just where to find. Not behind
the hay, where a poor wretch was almost dead with terror.
There was no nest there, and so she failed to see the
ghastly face, pinched with hunger and pain, the glassy
eyes, the uncombed hair, and soiled, tattered garments of
him who once was known as one of fashion’s most fastidious
dandies.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had secured her eggs for the morning meal, and the
doctor hoped she was about to leave, when there was a
rustling of the hay, and he almost uttered a scream of
fear. But the sound died on his lips, as he heard the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>voice of prayer—heard that young girl as she prayed,
and the words she uttered, stopped, for an instant, the
pulsation of his heart, and partly took his senses away.
First for her baby-boy she prayed, asking that God would
be to him father and mother both, and keep him from
temptation. Then for her <em>country</em>; and the doctor,
listening to her, knew it was no Rebel tongue calling so
earnestly on God to save the Union, praying so touchingly
for the poor, suffering soldiers, and coming at last to him,
the miserable outcast, whose bloodshot eyes grew blind,
and whose brain grew giddy and wild, as he heard again
<em>Lily’s voice</em>, pleading for <em>George</em>, wherever he might be.
She did not say, “God send him back to me, who loves
him still.” She only asked forgiveness for the father of
her boy, but this was proof to the listener that she did not
hate him, and forgetful of his pain he raised himself
upon his elbow, and looking over the pile of hay, saw
her where she knelt, Lily,—Adah,—his wife, her fair face
covered by her hands, and her soft, brown hair cut short,
and curling in her neck.</p>

<p class='c011'>Twice he essayed to speak, but his tongue refused to
move, and he sunk back exhausted, just as Adah rose
from her knees and turned to leave the barn. He could
not let her go. He should die before she came again; he
was half dying now, and it would be so sweet to breathe
out his life upon her bosom, with perhaps her forgiving
kiss upon his lips.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Adah!” he tried to say; but the quivering lips made
no sound, and Adah passed out, leaving him there alone.
“Adah, Lily, Anna,” he gasped, hardly knowing himself
whose name he called in his despair.</p>

<p class='c011'>She heard that sound, and started suddenly, for she
thought it was her old, familiar name, which no one knew
there at Sunny Mead. For a moment she paused; but
it came not again, and so she turned the corner, and her
shadow fell a second time on the haggard face pressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>against that crevice in the wall, the opening large enough
to thrust the long fingers through, in the wild hope of
detaining her as she passed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Adah!</em>”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a gasping, bitter cry; but it reached her, and
looking back, she saw the pale hand beckoning, the fingers
motioning feebly, as if begging her to return. There was
a moment’s hesitation, and then conquering her timidity,
Adah went back, shuddering as she passed the still beckoning
hand, and caught a glimpse of the wild eyes peering
at her through the crevice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Adah!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She heard it distinctly now, and with it came thoughts
of Hugh. It must be he; and her feet scarcely touched
the ground in her eagerness to find him. Over the threshold,
across the floor, and behind the hay she bounded;
out stood aghast at the spectacle before her. He had struggled
to his knees; and with his sprained limb coiled under
him, his ashen lips apart, and his arms stretched out,
he was waiting for her. But Adah did not spring into
those trembling arms, as once she would have done. She
would never willingly rest in their embrace again; and
utter, overwhelming surprise, was the only emotion visible
on her face as she recognized him, not so much by his
looks as by the name he gave her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“George, oh, George, how came you here?” she asked,
drawing backward from the arm reached out to touch her.</p>

<p class='c011'>He felt that he was repulsed, and, with a wail which
smote painfully on Adah’s heart, he fell forward on his
face, sobbing, “Oh, Adah, Lily, pity me, pity me, if you
can’t forgive! I have slept for three nights in the woods,
without once tasting food! My ankle is sprained, my
strength is gone, and I wish that I were dead!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She had drawn nearer to him while he spoke, near
enough to recognize her country’s uniform, all soiled and
tattered though it was. He was a soldier then—Liberty’s
loyal son—and that fact awoke a throb of pity.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>“George,” she said, kneeling down beside him, and laying
her hand upon his ragged coat, “tell me how came
you here, and where is your company?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He would not deceive her, though tempted to do so,
and he answered her truthfully, “Lily, I am a deserter.
I am trying to join the enemy!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He did not see the indignant flash of her eyes, or the
look of scorn upon her face, but he felt the reproach her
silence implied, and dared not look up.</p>

<p class='c011'>“George,” she began at last, sternly, very sternly, “but
for Him who bade us forgive seventy times seven, I should
feel inclined to leave you here to die; but when I remember
how much He is tried with me, I feel that I am to be
no one’s judge. Tell me, why you have deserted; and
tell me, too—oh, George, in mercy—tell me if you know
aught of <em>Willie</em>?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The mother had forgotten all the wrongs heaped upon
the wife, and Adah drew nearer to him now, <em>so</em> near indeed,
that his arm encircled her at last, and held her
close; but the ragged, dirty, fallen creature did not dare
to kiss her, and could only press her convulsively to his
breast, as he attempted an answer to her question.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You must be quick,” she said, suddenly remembering
herself; “it is growing late, Mrs. Ellsworth will be waiting
for her breakfast; and since the stampede of her servants,
two old negroes and myself are all there are left to
care for the house. Stay,” she added, as a new thought
seemed to strike her; “I must go, or they will look for
me; but after breakfast I will return, and do for you what
I can. Lie down again upon the hay.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She spoke kindly to him, but he felt it was as she
would have spoken to any one in distress, and not as once
she had addressed him. But he knew that he deserved
it; and he suffered her to leave him, watching her with
streaming eyes as she hurried along the path, and counting
the minutes, which seemed to him like hours, ere he saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>her returning. She was very white when she came back
and he noticed that she frequently glanced toward the
house, as if haunted by some terror. Constantly expecting
detection, he grasped her arm, as she bent to bathe his
swollen foot, and whispered huskily, “Adah, there’s something
on your mind—some evil you fear. Tell me, is
any one after me!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Adah nodded; while, like a frightened child, the tall
man clung to her neck, saying, piteously, “Don’t give me
up! Don’t tell; they would hang me, perhaps!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They ought to do so,” trembled on Adah’s lips, but
she suppressed the words, and went on bandaging up the
ankle, and handling it as carefully as if it had not belonged
to a deserter.</p>

<p class='c011'>He did not feel pain now in his anxiety, as he asked,
“Who is it, Adah? who’s after me?” but he started when
she replied, with downcast eyes and a flush upon her cheek,
“Major Irving Stanley. You were in his regiment,—the N. Y. Volunteers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Dr. Richards drew a relieved breath. “I’d rather it
were he than Captain Worthington, who hates me so
cordially. Adah, you must hide me; I have so much to
tell. I know your parents, your brother, your husband;
and I am he. It was not a mock marriage. It has been
proved real. It was a genuine Justice who married us,
and you are my lawful wife. Oh, pray, please don’t hurt
me so,” and he uttered a scream of pain as Adah’s hands
pressed heavily upon the hard, purple flesh.</p>

<p class='c011'>She scarcely knew what she was doing as she listened
to his words, and heard that she was indeed his wife.
Two years before, such news would have overwhelmed
her with delight, but now for a single instant a fierce
and almost resentful pang shot through her heart as she
thought of being bound for life to one for whom she had
no love, and whose very caresses made her loathe him
more and more. But when she thought of Willie, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>that the stain upon his birth was washed away, the hard
look left her eyes, and her hot tears dropped upon the
ankle she was bandaging.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are glad?” he asked, looking at her curiously, for
her manner puzzled him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, very glad for Willie,” she replied, keeping her
face bent down so he could not see its expression.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then when her task was done, she seemed to nerve
herself for some painful task, and sitting down upon the
hay said to him,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell me now all that has happened since I left Terrace
Hill; but first of Willie. You say Anna has
him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Anna—Mrs. Millbrook,” he replied, and was
about to say more, when Adah interrupted him with,</p>

<p class='c011'>“It may spare you some pain if I tell you first what I
know of the tragedy at Spring Bank. I know that
<em>’Lina</em> is dead, and that the fact of my existence prevented
the marriage. So much I heard Mrs. Ellsworth tell her
brother. I had just come to her then. She was prouder
toward me than she is now, and I dared not question her.
Go on, you spoke of my parents, my brother. Who are
they?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Her manner perplexed him greatly, but he controlled
himself, while he repeated rapidly the story known already
to our readers, the story which made Adah reel, and
turn so white that he attempted to reach her and so keep
her from falling. But just the touch of his hand had
power to rouse her, and drawing back she laid her face in
the hay, and moaned.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s more than I ever hoped. Oh, Heavenly Father
accept my thanks for this great happiness. A mother and
a brother found.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And husband, too,” chimed in the doctor, eagerly,
“thank him for me, Adah. You are glad to find me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a pleading in his tone—earnest pleading,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>for the terrible conviction was fastening itself upon him,
that not as they once parted had he and Adah met. For
full five minutes Adah lay upon the hay, her whole soul
going out in a prayer of thankfulness for her great joy, and
for strength to bear the bitterness mingling with her joy.
Her face was very white when she lifted it up at last, but
her manner was composed, and she questioned the doctor
calmly of Spring Bank, of Alice, of Hugh, of Anna,
but could not trust herself to say much to him of Willie,
lest her calmness should give way, and a feeling spring
up in her heart of something like affection for Willie’s
father. Alas, for the miserable man. He had found his
wife, but there was between them a gulf which his own
act had built, and which he never more might pass. He
began to suspect it, and ere she had finished the story of
her wanderings, which at his request she told, he knew
there was no pulsation of her heart which beat for him.
He asked her where she had been since she fled from
Terrace Hill, and how she came to be in Mrs. Ellsworth’s
family.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a moment’s hesitancy, as if she was deciding
how much to tell him of the past, and then resolving
to keep nothing back which he might know, she told him
how, with a stunned heart and giddy brain, she had gone
to Albany, and mingling with the crowd had mechanically
followed them down to a boat just starting for New
York. That, by some means, she found herself in the saloon,
and seated next to a feeble, deformed little girl, who
lay upon the sofa, and whose sweet, childish voice said to
her pityingly,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Does your head ache, lady, or what makes you so
white?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She had responded to that appeal, talking kindly to the
little girl, between whom and herself the friendliest of relations
were established, and whose name, she learned, was
Jenny Ellsworth. The mother she did not then see, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>during the journey down the river she was suffering from
a nervous headache, and kept her room. From the child
and child’s nurse, however, she heard that Mrs. Ellsworth
was going to Europe, and was anxious to secure some
competent person to act in the capacity of Jenny’s governess.
Instantly Adah’s decision was made. Once in
New York she would by letter apply for the situation, for
nothing then could so well suit her state of mind as a
tour to Europe, where she would be far away from all she
had ever known. Very adroitly she ascertained Mrs. Ellsworth’s
address, wrote her a note the day following her
arrival in New York, and the day following that, found
her in Mrs. Ellsworth’s parlor at the Brevoort House,
where for a few days she was stopping. It had troubled
her somewhat to know what name to take, but she decided
finally upon Adah Gordon as the one by which she
was known ere George Hastings crossed her path, and in
her note to Mrs. Ellsworth she signed herself “<span class='sc'>A Gordon</span>.”
From her little girl Mrs. Ellsworth had heard much of the
“sweet young lady, who was so kind to her on the boat,”
and was thus already prepossessed in her favor.</p>

<p class='c011'>Adah did not tell Dr. Richards, and perhaps she did
not herself know how surprised and delighted Mrs. Ellsworth
was with the fair, girlish creature, announced to her
as Miss Gordon, and who won her heart before five minutes
were gone, making her think it of no consequence to
inquire concerning her at Madam ——’s school, where she
said she had once been a pupil.</p>

<p class='c011'>Naturally very impulsive and unsuspecting, Mrs. Ellsworth
usually acted upon her likes or dislikes, and Adah
was soon installed as governess to the delighted little
Jennie, who learned to love her gentle teacher with a love
almost amounting to idolatry.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You were in Europe, then, and that is the reason why
we could not find you,” Dr. Richards said, adding, after
a moment, “And Irving Stanley went with you—was
your companion all the while?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>“Yes, all the while,” and Adah’s cold fingers worked
nervously at the wisp of hay she was twisting in her
hand. “We came home sooner than we intended, as he
was anxious to join the army. I had seen him before—he
was in the cars when Willie and I were on our way
to Terrace Hill. Willie had the ear-ache, and he was so
kind to us both.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Adah looked fixedly now at the craven doctor, who
could not meet her glance, for well he remembered the
dastardly part he had played in that scene, where his own
child was screaming with pain, and he sat selfishly idle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She don’t know I was there, though,” he thought, and
that gave him some comfort.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Adah did know, and she meant he should know
she did. Keeping her eyes still fixed upon him, she continued,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I heard Mr. Stanley talking of you once to his sister,
and among other things he spoke of your dislike for children,
and referred to an occasion in the cars, when a little
boy, for whom his heart ached, was suffering acutely
and for whom you evinced no interest, except to say that
you <em>hated</em> children, and to push his feet from your lap. I
never knew till then that you were so near to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s true, it’s true,” the doctor cried, tears rolling down
his soiled face; “but I never guessed it was you. Lily, I
supposed it some ordinary woman.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So did Irving Stanley,” was Adah’s quiet, cutting answer;
“but his heart was open to sympathy, even for an
ordinary woman.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The doctor could only moan, with his face still hidden
in his hands, until a sudden thought like a revelation flashed
upon him, and forgetting his wounded foot, he sprang
like a tiger to the spot where Adah sat, and winding his
arm firmly around her, whispered hoarsely,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Adah, you <em>love Irving Stanley</em>. My wife loves another
than her husband.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>Adah did not struggle to release herself from his
grasp, but her whole soul loathed that close embrace,
and the loathing expressed itself in the tone of her voice,
as she replied,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Until within an hour I did not suppose you were my
husband. You said you were not in that letter; I have
it yet; the one in which you told me it was a mock
marriage, as, by your own confession, it seems you meant
it should be.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, darling, you kill me, yet I deserve it all; but
Adah, I have suffered enough to atone for the dreadful
past; and I tried so hard to find you. Forgive me, Lily,
forgive,” and falling again on his knees, the wretched man
poured forth a torrent of entreaties for her forgiveness,
her love, without which he should die.</p>

<p class='c011'>Holding fast her cold hands, he pleaded with all his
eloquence, until, maddened by her silence, he even
taunted her with loving another, while her own husband
was living.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Adah started, and pushing him away, sprang to
her feet, while the hot blood stained her face and neck,
and a resentful fire gleamed from her brown eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is not well for you to reproach me with faithlessness,”
she said, “you, who have dealt so treacherously
by me; you, who deliberately planned my ruin, and would
have effected it but for the deeper-laid scheme of one
you say is my father. No thanks to you that I am a lawful
wife. You did not make me so of your own free will.
You did to me the greatest wrong a man can do a woman,
then cruelly deserted me, and now you would chide me for
respecting another more than I do you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not respecting him, Adah, no, not for respecting him.
You should do that. He’s worthier than I; but, oh,
Adah, Lily, wife, mother of my boy, do you love Irving
Stanley?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He was sobbing bitterly, and the words came between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>the sobs, while he tried to clutch her dress. Staggering
backward against the wooden beam, Adah leaned there for
support, while she replied,</p>

<p class='c011'>“You would not understand if I should tell you the
terrible struggle it was for me to be thrown each day in
the society of one as noble, as good as Irving Stanley, and
not come at last to feel for him as a poor governess ought
never to feel for the handsome, gifted brother of her
employer. Oh, George, I prayed against it so much, prayed
to be kept from the sin, if it were a sin, to have Irving
Stanley mingled with every thought. But the more I
prayed, the more the temptation seemed thrust upon me.
The kinder, gentler, more attentive, grew his manners
toward me. He never treated me as a mere governess.
It was more like an equal at first, and then like a younger
sister, so that few strangers took me for a subordinate, so
kind were both Mrs. Ellsworth and her brother.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And he,” the doctor gasped, looking wistfully in her
face, “does he—do you think he loves <em>you</em>?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Adah colored crimson, but answered frankly,</p>

<p class='c011'>“He never told me so; never said to me a word which
a husband should not hear; but—sometimes, I’ve left
him abruptly lest he should speak, for that I knew would
bring the crisis I so dreaded. I must tell him the whole
then, and by my dread of doing this, I knew he was more
than a friend to me. I was fearful at first that he might
recognize me, but I was much thinner than when I saw
him in the cars, while my hair, purposely worn short, and
curling in my neck, changed my looks materially, so that
he only wondered whom I was so much like, but never
suspected the truth.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was silence, a moment, and then the doctor asked,
“How is all this to end?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The question brought into Adah’s eyes a fearful look of
anguish, but she did not answer, and the doctor spoke
again.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>“Have I found Lily only to lose her?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Still there was no reply, and the doctor continued, “You
are my wife, Adah. No power can undo that, save death,
and you are my child’s mother. For Willie’s sake, oh
Adah, for Willie’s sake, forgive.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When he appealed to her as his wife, Adah seemed turning
into stone; but the mention of Willie, touched the
mother, and the iceberg melted at once.</p>

<p class='c011'>“For Willie, my boy,” she gasped, “I could do
almost anything; I could <em>die</em> so willingly, but—but—oh,
George, that ever we should come to this. You a
deserter, a traitor to your country—lame, disabled, wholly
in my power, and begging of <em>me</em>, your outcast wife, for
the love which surely is dead—dead. No, George, I do
forgive, but never, never more can I be to you a wife.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a rising resentment now in the doctor’s manner,
as he answered reproachfully: “Then surrender me
at once to the lover hunting for me. Let him take me
back where I can be shot, and that will leave you free.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Adah raised her hand deprecatingly, and when he had
finished, rejoined: “You mistake Maj. Stanley, if you
think he would marry me, knowing what I should tell
him. It’s not for him that I refuse. It’s for myself. I
could not bear it. I—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Stay, Adah, Lily, don’t say you should hate me;” and
the doctor’s voice was so full of anguish that Adah involuntarily
advanced toward him, standing quite near, while he
begged of her to say if the past could not be forgotten.
His family were anxious to receive her. Sweet Anna
Millbrook already loved her as a sister, while he, her
husband, words could not tell his love for her. He would
do whatever she required; go back to the Federal army
if she said so; seek for the pardon he was sure to gain;
fight for his country like a hero, periling life and limb, if
she would only give him the shadow of a hope.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must have time to think. I cannot decide alone,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>Adah answered, while the doctor clutched her dress, half
shrieking with terror,</p>

<p class='c011'>“You surely will not consult Major Stanley?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” and Adah spoke reverently, “there’s a mightier
friend than he. One who has never failed me in my need.
He will tell me what to do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The doctor knew now what she meant, and with a moan
he laid his head again upon the hay, wishing, so much
that the lessons taught him when in that little attic chamber,
years ago, he knelt by Adah’s side, and said with her,
“Our Father,” had not been all forgotten. When he
lifted up his face again, Adah was gone, but he knew she
would return, and waited patiently while just outside the
door, with her fair face buried in the sweet Virginia
grass, and the warm summer sunshine falling softly upon
her, poor half-crazed Adah fought and won the fiercest
battle <em>she</em> had ever known, coming off conqueror over self,
and feeling sure that God had heard her earnest cry for
help, and told her what to do. There was no wavering
now; her step was firm; her voice steady, as she went
back to the doctor’s side, and bending over him, said,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will nurse you, till you are well; then you must go
back whence you came, confess your fault, rejoin your regiment,
and by your faithfulness wipe out the stain of desertion.
Then, when the war is over, or you are honorably
discharged, I will—be your wife. I may not love
you at first as once I did, but I shall try, and He, who
counsels me to tell you this will help me, I am sure.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was almost pitiful now to see the doctor, as he crouched
at Adah’s feet, kissing her hands and blessing her
‘mid his tears. “He would be worthy of her, and they
should yet be so happy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Adah suffered him to caress her for a moment, and
then told him she must go, for Mrs. Ellsworth would
wonder at her long absence, and possibly institute a
search. Pressing one more kiss upon her hand the doctor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>crept back to his hiding place, while Adah went slowly
back to the house where she knew Irving Stanley was
anxiously waiting for her. She dared not meet him alone
now, for latterly each time they had so met, she had kept
at bay the declaration trembling on his lips, and which
must never be listened to. So she staid away from the
pleasant parlor where all the morning he sat chatting
with his sister, who guessed how much he loved the beautiful
and accomplished girl, her daughter’s governess.</p>

<p class='c011'>Right-minded and high-principled, Mrs. Ellsworth had
conquered any pride she might at first have felt—any reluctance
to her brother’s marrying her governess, and
now like him was anxious to have it settled. But Adah
gave him no chance that day, and late in the afternoon
he rode back to his regiment wondering at the change in
Miss Gordon, and why her face was so deadly white, and
her voice so husky, as she bade him good-bye.</p>

<p class='c011'>Poor Adah! Hers was now a path of suffering, such
as she had never known before. But she did her duty to
the doctor, nursing him with the utmost care; but never
expressing to him the affection she did not feel. It was
impossible to keep his presence there a secret from the
two old negroes, and knowing she could trust them, she
told them of the wounded Union soldier, enlisting their
sympathies for him, and thus procuring for him the care
of older and more experienced people than herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was able at length to return, and one pleasant summer
night, just three weeks after his arrival at Sunnymead,
Adah walked with him to the woods, and kneeling with
him by a running stream, whose waters farther away
would yet be crimson with the blood of our slaughtered
brothers, she commended him to God. Through the leafy
branches the moon-beams were shining, and they showed
to Adah the expression of the doctor’s wasted face, as
he said to her at parting, “I have kissed you many times,
my darling, but you have never returned it. Please do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>so once, for the sake of the olden time. It will make me
a better soldier.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She kissed him once for the sake of the olden time, and
when he whispered, “Again for Willie’s sake,” she kissed
him twice, and then she bade him leave her, herself buttoning
about him the soldier coat which her own hands
had cleaned and mended and made respectable. She was
glad afterward that she had done so; glad, too, that she
had kissed him and waited by the tree, where, looking
backward, he could see the flutter of her white dress until
a turn in the forest path hid her from his view.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXVII.<br> <span class='large'>THE SECOND BATTLE OF BULL RUN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The second disastrous battle of Bull Run was over,
and the shadow of a summer night wrapped the field of
carnage in darkness. Thickly upon the battle field lay
the dead and dying, the sharp, bitter cries of the latter
rising on the night wind, and adding tenfold to the horror
of the scene. In the woods, not very far away, more
than one brave soldier was weltering in his life-blood, just
where, in his rapid flight, he had fallen, the grass his pillow,
and the leafy branches of the forest trees his only
covering.</p>

<p class='c011'>Near to a running brook one wounded man was supporting
another and trying to staunch the purple gore,
pouring darkly from a fearful bullet wound in the region
of the heart. The stronger of the two, he who wore a
major’s uniform, had come accidentally upon the other,
writhing in agony, and muttering at intervals snatches of the
prayer with which he once had been familiar, and which
seemed to bring <em>Lily</em> back to him again, just as she was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>when in the attic chamber she made him kneel by her, and
say “Our Father.” He tried to say it now, and the whispered
words caught the ear of Irving Stanley, arresting
his steps at once.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor fellow! it’s gone hard with you,” he said, kneeling
by the sufferer, whom he recognized as the deserter
<em>Dr. Richards</em>, who had returned to his allegiance, had
craved forgiveness for his sins, and been restored to the
ranks, discharging his duties faithfully, and fighting that
day with a zeal and energy which did much in reinstating
him in the good opinion of those who witnessed his daring
bravery.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the doctor’s work was done, and never from his
lips would Lily know how well his promise had been
kept. Giddy with pain and weak from the loss of blood,
he had groped his way through the woods, fighting back
the horrid certainty that to-morrow’s sun would not rise
for him, and sinking at length exhausted upon the grass,
whose freshness was now defaced by the blood which
poured so freely from his wound.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was thus that Irving Stanley found him, starting at first
as from a hissing shell, and involuntarily clasping his
hand over the place where lay a little note, received a
few days before, a reply to the earnest declaration of love
he had at last written to his sister’s governess. There
was but one alternative, and Adah met it resolutely, though
every fibre of her heart throbbed with keen agony as she
told to Irving Stanley the story of her life. She was a
wife, a mother, the sister of Hugh Worthington, they
said, <em>the Adah</em> for whom Dr. Richards had sought so long
in vain, and for whom Murdoch, the wicked father, was
seeking still for aught she knew to the contrary. Even
the story of the doctor’s secretion in the barn at Sunnymead
was confessed. Nothing was withheld except the
fact that even as he professed to love her, so she in turn
loved him, or had done so before she knew it was a sin.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>Surprise had, for a few moments stifled every other emotion,
and Irving Stanley sat like one suddenly bereft of
life, when he read who Adah was. Then came the bitter
thought that he had lost her, mingled with a deep feeling
of resentment towards the man who had so cruelly wronged
the gentle girl, and who alone stood between him and
happiness. For Irving Stanley could overlook all the
rest. His great warm heart, so full of kindly sympathy
and generous charity for all mankind could take to its
embrace the fair sweet woman he had learned to love
so much, and be a father to her little boy, as if it had
been his own. But this might not be. There was a
mighty obstacle in the way, and feeling that it mattered
little now whether he ever came from the field alive, Irving
Stanley, with a whispered prayer for strength to bear
and do right, had hidden the letter in his bosom, and then,
when the hour of conflict came, plunged into the thickest
of the fight with a fearlessness born of keen and recent
disappointment, which made life less valuable than it had
been before.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is not strange, then, that he should start and stagger
backward when he came so suddenly upon the doctor, or
that the first impulse of weak human nature was to leave
the fallen man; but the second, the Christian impulse, bade
him stay, and forgetting his own slight but painful wound,
he bent over Adah’s husband, and did what he could to
alleviate the anguish he saw was so hard to bear. At
the sound of his voice, a spasm of pain passed over the
doctor’s pallid face, and the flash of a sudden fire gleamed
for a moment in his eye, as he, too, remembered <em>Adah</em>,
and thought of what might be when the grass was growing
over his untimely grave.</p>

<p class='c011'>The doctor knew that he was dying, and yet his first
question was—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you think I can live? Did any one ever recover
with such a wound as this?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>Eagerly the dim eyes sought the face above them, the
kind, good face of one who would not deceive him. Irving
shook his head as he felt the pulse, and answered frankly,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I believe you will die.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a bitter moan, as all his misspent life came
up before him, followed closely by the dark future, where
there shone no ray of hope, and then with the desperate
thought, “It’s too late now for regrets. I’ll meet it like
a man,” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It may as well be I as any one, though it’s hard even
for me to die; harder than you imagine;” then, growing
excited as he talked, he raised himself upon his elbow,
and continued, “Major Stanley, tell me truly, do you love
the woman you know as Adah Gordon?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I did love her before I knew I must not—but now—I—yes,
Dr. Richards, my heart tells me that never
was she so dear to me as now when her husband lies dying
at my side.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Irving Stanley hardly knew what he was saying, but
the doctor understood, and almost shrieked out the
words,</p>

<p class='c011'>“You know then that she is Adah, a wife, a mother
and that I am her lawful husband?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know the whole,” was the reply, as with his hand
Irving dipped water from the brook and laved the feverish
brow of the dying man, who went on to speak of
Adah as she was when he first knew her, and of the few
happy months spent with her in those humble lodgings.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You don’t know my darling,” he whispered. “She’s
an angel, and I might have been so happy with her. Oh,
if I <em>could</em> only live, but that can’t be now, and it is well.
Come close to me, Major Stanley, and listen while I tell
you that Adah promised if I would do my duty to my
country faithfully, she would live with me again, and all
the while she promised, her heart was breaking, for she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>did not love me. It had all died out for me. It had been
given to another; can you guess to whom?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Irving made no reply, except to chafe the hands which
clasped his so tightly, and the doctor continued,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am surely dying—I shall never see her more, or my
beautiful boy. I was a brute in the cars; you remember
the time. That was Adah, and those little feet resting
on my lap were Willie’s, baby Willie’s, Adah’s baby.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The doctor’s mind was wandering now, and he kept on
disconnectedly,</p>

<p class='c011'>“She’s been to Europe with him. She’s changed from
the shy girl into a queenly woman. Even the Richards
line might be proud of her bearing, and when I’m gone,
tell her I said you might have Willie, and—and—it
grows very dark; the noise of the battle drowns my voice,
but come nearer to me, nearer—tell her—tell Adah, you
may have her. She needn’t mourn, nor wait; but carry
me back to Snowdon. There’s no soldier’s grave there
yet. I never thought mine would be the first. Anna
will cry, and mother and Asenath and Eudora; but Adah,
oh Lily, darling. She’s coming to me now. Don’t you
hear that rustle in the grass?” and the doctor listened intently
to a sound which also caught Irving’s ear, a sound
of a horse’s neigh in the distance, followed by a tramp of
feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hush-sh,” he whispered. “It may be the enemy,” but
his words were not regarded, or understood.</p>

<p class='c011'>The doctor was in Lily’s presence, and in fancy it was
<em>her</em> hand, not Irving’s which wiped the death-sweat from
his brow, and he murmured words of love and fond endearment,
as to a living, breathing form. Fainter and
fainter grew the pulse, weaker and weaker grew the trembling
voice, until at last Irving could only comprehend
that some one was bidden to pray—to say “Our Father.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Reverently, as for a departing brother, he prayed over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>the dying man, asking that all the past might be forgiven,
and that the erring might rest at last in peace.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Say Amen for me, I’m too weak,” the doctor whispered;
then, as reason asserted her sway again, he continued
“I see it now; Lily’s gone, and I am dying here in the
woods, in the dark, in the night, on the ground; cared for
by you who will be Lily’s husband. You may, you may,
tell her I said so; tell her kiss my boy; love him, Major
Stanley; love him as your own, even though others shall
call you father. Tell her—I tried—to pray—”</p>

<p class='c011'>He never spoke again; and when next the thick, black,
clotted blood oozed up from the gaping wound, it brought
with it all there was of life; and there in those Virginia
woods, in the darkness of the night, Irving Stanley sat
alone with the dead. And yet not alone, for away to his
right, and where the neigh of a horse had been heard,
another wounded soldier lay—his soft, brown locks moist
with dew, and his captain’s uniform wet with the blood
which dripped from the terrible gash in the fleshy part of
the neck, where a murderous ball had been. One arm,
the right one, was broken, and lay disabled upon the
grass; while the hand of the other clutched occasionally
at the damp grass, and then lifting itself, stroked caressingly
the powerful limbs of the faithful creature standing
guard over the prostrate form of his master.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hugh and Rocket! They had been in many battles,
and neither shot nor shell had harmed them until to-day,
when Hugh had received the charge which sent him reeling
from his horse, breaking his arm in the fall, and scarcely
conscious that two of his comrades were leading him
from the field. How or by what means he afterwards
reached the woods, he did not know, but reached them he
had, and unable to travel further, he had fallen to the
ground, where he lay, until Rocket came galloping near,
riderless, frightened, and looking for his master. With a
cry of joy the noble brute answered that master’s faint
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>whistle, bounding at once to his side, and by many mute
but meaning signs, signifying his desire that Hugh should
mount as heretofore.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Hugh was too weak for that, and after several
ineffectual efforts to rise, fell back half fainting on the turf;
while Rocket took his stand directly over him, a powerful
and efficient guard until help from some quarter should
arrive. Patiently, faithfully he stood, waiting as quietly
as if he knew that aid was coming, not far away, in the
form of an old man, whose hair was white as snow, and
whose steps were feeble with age, but who had the advantage
of knowing every inch of that ground, for he had
trodden it many a time, with a homesick heart which pined
for “old Kentuck,” whence he had been stolen.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Uncle Sam!</em> He it was whose uncertain steps made
Rocket prick up his ears and listen, neighing at last a
neigh of welcome, by which he, too, was recognized.</p>

<p class='c011'>“De dear Father be praised if that be’nt Rocket hisself.
I’ve found him, I’ve found my Massah Hugh. I tole Miss
Ellis I should, ’case I knows all de way. Dear Massah
Hugh, I’se <em>Sam</em>, I is,” and with a convulsive sob the old
negro knelt beside the white-faced man who, but for this
timely aid, could hardly have survived that fearful night.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXVIII.<br> <span class='large'>HUGH AND SAM.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>It is more than a year now since last we looked in upon
the inmates of Spring Bank, and during that time Kentucky
had been the scene of violence, murder, and bloodshed.
The roar of artillery had been heard upon its hills. Soldiers
wearing the Federal uniform had marched up and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>down its beaten paths, encamping for a brief season in
its capital, and then departing to other points where their
services were needed more.</p>

<p class='c011'>Morgan, with his fierce band of guerillas, had carried
terror, dismay, and sometimes death, to many a peaceful
home; while <em>Harney</em>, too, disdaining open, honorable warfare,
had joined himself, it was said, to a horde of savage
marauders, gathered, some from Texas, some from Mississippi,
and a few from Tennessee; but none, to her credit
be it said, none from Kentucky, save their chief, the <em>Rebel
Harney</em>, who, despised and dreaded almost equally by
Unionists and Confederates, kept the country between
Louisville and Lexington in a constant state of excitement.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the storm grew blacker, it had seemed necessary for
Colonel Tiffton openly to avow his sentiments, and not
“sneak between two fires, for fear of being burned,” as
Harney wolfishly told him one day, taunting him with
being a “villainous Yankee,” and hinting darkly of the
punishment preparing for all such.</p>

<p class='c011'>The colonel was not cowardly, but, as was natural, he
<em>did</em> lean to the Confederacy. “Peaceful separation, if
possible,” was his creed; and fully believing the South
destined to triumph, he took that side at last, greatly to
the delight of his high-spirited Nell, who had been a Rebel
from the first. With a look of reproach which the Colonel
never forgot, Alice Johnson listened to his reasons for
joining himself with the Secessionists, but when at the
close of his arguments he kindly advised her to be a little
more careful in expressing her opinions, saying there was
no knowing what Harney, who was known to be bitterly
prejudiced against Spring Bank, might be tempted to do,
her blue eyes flashed proudly as she replied, “I should be
unworthy of the state which gave me birth, were I afraid
to say what I think. No, I am not afraid; and should
Harney, with his whole band of marauders, attack our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>house, he will find at least one who is not a coward. I
would not deny my country to save my life. Still, I do
not think it right to expose myself unnecessarily to danger,
and as Mrs. Worthington is very timid, and very
anxious to go North, where there is safety, I too have
concluded that it is best to leave Spring Bank for a time.
Aunt Eunice, who is afraid of nothing, will remain in
charge of the house, while you, we hope, will have a care
for the negroes until we return, or Hugh, if that time
ever comes,” and Alice’s voice trembled as she thought
how long it was since they had heard from Hugh, three
months having elapsed since a word had come to them
from him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Col. Tiffton was glad Alice was going North, for in
those excited times he knew not what harm might befall
her, alone and unprotected as she was at Spring Bank.
He would willingly take charge of the negroes, he said,
and he kindly offered to do whatever he could to expedite
her departure. Alice would not confess to him that
the great object of her going North was the hope she had
of being nearer Hugh, for it was arranged between herself
and Mrs. Worthington that, after stopping for a few
days in Snowdon they should go on to Washington where
some tidings might be received of the soldier, and where
they might perhaps hear from Adah, who had not yet
been found. This was Alice’s plan, and after receiving
the Colonel’s approbation, she communicated it to the negroes,
telling it first to Sam, who begged earnestly to go
with her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t leave me, Miss Ellis. Take me ’long, please
take me to Massah Hugh. I’se quite peart now, and kin
look after Miss Ellis a heap.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice could not promise till she had talked with Mrs.
Worthington, who offered no objection, and it was arranged
that with Densie, Sam, and Lulu, they should start at
once for Snowdon. Accordingly, one week after Alice’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>conversation with Col. Tiffton she bade adieu to Spring
Bank and was on her way to the North, where there was
safety and quiet.</p>

<hr class='c014'>

<p class='c011'>Anna Millbrook’s eyes were dim with tears, and her
heart was sore with pain, when told that Alice Johnson
was waiting for her in the parlor below. Only the day
before had she heard of her brother’s disgrace, feeling as
she heard it, how much rather she would that he had died
ere there were so many stains upon his name. But <em>Alice</em>
would comfort her, and she hastened to meet her. Sitting
down beside her, she talked with her long of all that
had transpired since last they met; talked of Adah, and
then of Willie, who at Alice’s request, was taken by her to
the hotel, where Mrs. Worthington was stopping. He
had grown to be a most beautiful and engaging child,
and Mrs. Worthington justly felt a thrill of pride as she
clasped him to her bosom, weeping over him passionately.
She could scarcely bear to lose him from her sight, and
when later in the day Anna came down for him, she begged
hard for him to stay. But Willie preferred returning
with Mrs. Millbrook, who promised that he should come
every day so long as Mrs. Worthington remained at the
hotel.</p>

<p class='c011'>As soon as Mrs. Richards learned that Mrs. Worthington
and Alice were in town, she insisted upon their coming
to Terrace Hill. There were the pleasant chambers
fitted up for ’Lina, they had never been occupied, and
Mrs. Worthington could have them as well as not; or
better yet—could take Anna’s old chamber, with the little
room adjoining, where Adah used to sleep. Mrs.
Worthington preferred the latter, and removed with Alice
to Terrace Hill, while at Anna’s request Densie went
to Riverside Cottage, where she used to live, and where
she was much happier than she would have been with
strangers.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>Not long however could Mrs. Worthington remain contentedly
at Snowdon, and after a time Alice started with
her and Lulu for Washington, taking with them Sam, who
seemed a perfect child in his delight at the prospect of
seeing “Massah Hugh.” From a soldier returning home
on furlough they heard that he was with his Regiment
but to see him was not so easy a matter. Indeed, he
seemed farther off at Washington than he had done at
Spring Bank, and Alice sometimes questioned the propriety
of having left Kentucky at all. They were not very
comfortable at Washington, and as Mrs. Worthington
pined for the pure country air, Alice managed at last to
procure board at the house of a friend whose acquaintance
she had made at the time of her visits to Virginia. It was
some distance from Washington, and so near to Bull Run
that when at last the second battle was fought in that
vicinity, the roar of the artillery was distinctly heard,
and they who listened to the noise of that bloody conflict
knew just when the battle ceased, and thought with tearful
anguish of the poor, maimed, suffering wretches left to
bleed and die alone. They knew <em>Hugh</em> must have been
in the battle, and Mrs. Worthington’s anxiety amounted
almost to insanity, while Alice, with blanched cheek and
compressed lip, could only pray silently that he might be
spared. Only Sam thought of acting.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now is my time,” he said to Alice, as they stood talking
together of Hugh, and wondering if he were safe.
“Something tell me Massah Hugh is hurted somewhar,
and I’se gwine to find him. I knows all de way, an’ every
tree round dat place. I can hide from de ’Federacy.
Dem Rebels let ole white-har’d nigger look for young
massah, and I’se gwine. P’raps I not find him, but I
does somebody some good. I helps somebody’s Massah
Hugh.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It seemed a crazy project, letting that old man start off
on so strange an errand, but Sam was determined.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>“He had a ’sentiment,” as he said, “that Hugh was
wounded, and he must go to him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In his presentiment Alice had no faith; but she did
not oppose him, and at parting she said to him hesitatingly,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sam,—did you,—do you,—has it ever occurred to
you that your master cared particularly for me;—that is,—cared,—you
know how,” and Alice blushed scarlet
while Sam replied eagerly, “Yes, Miss, Sam got mizzable
memory, but he knows dat ar, and it passes him what
Massah Hugh done jine de army for, when he might stay
home and haved Miss Ellis just as Sam pray he might so
long. Massah Hugh and Miss Ellis make good span. I
tell Massah. Shall I?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not unless you find him wounded and believe him
dying, then, you may tell him,—tell him—that I said—I
loved him; and had he ever come back, I would have
been his wife.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I tells him,” was Sam’s reply, as he departed on his
errand of mercy, which proved not to be a fruitless one,
for he <em>did</em> find his master, and falling on his knees beside
him, uttered the joyful words we have before repeated.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the faint, half-dying Hugh that familiar voice from
home and that dusky form bending over him so pityingly,
seemed more like a dream than a reality. He could not
comprehend how Sam came there, or what he was saying
to him. Something he heard of ole Miss and Snow-down,
and Washington; but nothing was real until he caught
the name of <em>Alice</em>, and thought Sam said she was there.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where, Sam—where?” he asked, trying to raise
himself upon his elbow. “Is Alice here, did you say?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, massah; not ’zactly here—but on de road. If
massah could ride, Sam hold him on, like massah oncet
held on ole Sam, and we’ll get to her directly. They’s
kind o’ Secesh folks whar she is, but mighty good to her.
She knowed ’em ’fore, ’case way down here is whar Sam
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>was sold dat time Miss Ellis comed and show him de road
to <em>Can’an</em>. Miss Ellis tell me somethin’ nice for Massah
Hugh, ef he’s dyin’—suffin make him so glad. Is you
dyin’, massah?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hardly think I am as bad as that. Can’t you tell
unless I am near to death?” Hugh said; and Sam replied,</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, massah; dem’s my orders. ‘Ef he’s dyin’, Sam
tell him I’—dat’s what she say. Maybe you <em>is</em> dyin’,
massah. Feel and see!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s possible,” and something like his old mischievous
smile played round Hugh’s white lips as he asked how a
chap felt when he was dying.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’se got mizzable mem’ry, and I don’t justly ’member,”
was Sam’s answer; “but I reckons he feel berry queer and
choky—berry.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s exactly my case, so you may venture to tell,”
Hugh said; and getting his face close to that of the young
man, Sam whispered “She say, ‘Tell massah Hugh—I—I’—you’s
<em>sure</em> you’s dyin’?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m sure I feel as you said I must,” Hugh replied,
and Sam went on. “‘Tell him I loves him; and ef he
lives I’ll be his wife.’ Dem’s her very words, nigh as I
can ’member—but what is massah goin’ to do” he continued,
in some surprise, as Hugh attempted to rise.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do, I’m going to Alice,” was Hugh’s reply, as with a
moan he sank back again, too weak to rise alone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you be’nt dyin’, after all,” was Sam’s rueful
comment, as he suggested, “Ef massah only clamber onto
Rocket.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was easier proposed than done, but after several
trials Hugh succeeded; and, with Sam steadying him
while he half lay on Rocket’s neck, he proceeded slowly
and safely through the woods, meeting at last with
some Unionists, who gave him what aid they could, and
did not leave him until they saw him safely deposited in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>an ambulance, which, in spite of his entreaties, took him
direct to Georgetown. It was a bitter disappointment to
Hugh, so bitter, indeed, that he scarcely felt the pain
when his broken arm was set; and when, at last, he was
left alone in his narrow hospital bed, he turned his face to
the wall, and cried, just as many a poor, homesick soldier
had done before him, and will do again.</p>

<hr class='c014'>

<p class='c011'>Twenty-four hours had passed, and in Hugh’s room it
was growing dark again. All the day he had watched anxiously
the door through which visitors would enter, asking
repeatedly if no one had called for him; but just as the
sun was going down he fell away to sleep, dreaming at
last that <em>Golden Hair</em> was there—that her soft, white
hands were on his brow, her sweet lips pressed to his,
while her dear voice murmured softly, “Darling Hugh!”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a cry of pain from a distant corner, and
Hugh awoke to know it was no dream—the soft hands
on his brow, the kiss upon his lips—for <em>Golden Hair was</em>
there; and by the tears she dropped upon his face, and
the caresses she gave him, he knew that Sam had told
him truly. For several minutes there was silence between
them, while the eyes looked into each other with a deeper
meaning than words could have expressed; then
smoothing back his damp brown hair, and letting her fingers
still rest upon his forehead, Alice whispered to him,
“I loved you, Hugh, when you left home, and I hoped
that first note would have told you so. I wish it had, for
then we need not have been separated so long.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Winding his well arm round her neck, and drawing her
nearer to him, Hugh answered,</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was best just as it is. Had I been sure of your
love, I should have found it harder to leave home. My
country needed me. I am glad I have done what I could
to defend it. Glad that I joined the army, for Alice, darling,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>Golden Hair, in my lonely tent reading that little
Bible you gave me so long ago, the Saviour found me, and
now, whether I live or not, it is well, for if I die, I am
sure you will be mine in Heaven; and if I live——”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice finished the sentence for him,</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you live, God willing, I shall be your wife. Dear
Hugh, I bless the Good Father, first for bringing you to
Himself, and then restoring you to me.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXIX.<br> <span class='large'>GOING HOME.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The village hearse was waiting at Snowdon depot, and
close beside it stood the carriage from Terrace Hill; the
one sent there for Adah, the other for her husband, whose
life-blood, so freely shed, had wiped away all stains upon
his memory, and enshrined him in the hearts of Snowdon’s
people as a martyr. He was the first dead soldier returned
to them, his the first soldier’s grave in their churchyard;
and so a goodly throng were there, with plaintive fife and
muffled drum, to do him honor. His major was coming with
him, it was said—Major Stanley, who had himself been
found in a half-fainting condition watching by the dead—Major
Stanley, who had seen that the body was embalmed,
had written to the wife, and had attended to everything,
even to coming on himself by way of showing his respect.
Death is a great softener of errors; and the village people,
who could not remember a time when they had not disliked
John Richards, forgot his faults now that he was
dead.</p>

<p class='c011'>It seemed a long time waiting for the train, but it came
at last, and the crowd involuntarily made a movement
forward, and then drew back as a tall figure appeared up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>on the platform, his uniform betokening an officer of rank,
and his manner showing plainly that he was master of
ceremonies.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Major Stanley,” ran in a whisper through the crowd,
whose wonder increased when another, and, if possible, a
finer-looking man, emerged into view, his right arm in a
sling, and his face pale and worn, from the effects of recent
illness. <em>He</em> had not been expected, and many curious
glances were cast at him as, slowly descending the steps,
he gave his hand to Mrs. Worthington following close
behind. They knew her, and recognized also the two
young ladies, Alice and Adah, as they sprang from the car.
Poor Adah! how she shrank from the public gaze, shuddering
as, on her way to the carriage, she passed the long
box the men were handling so carefully.</p>

<p class='c011'>Summoned by Irving Stanley, she had come on to
Washington, and while there, had learned that Mrs. Worthington,
Hugh, and Alice were all in Georgetown, whither
she hastened at once. Immediately after the discovery
of her parentage, she had written to Kentucky, but the
letter had not reached its destination, consequently no
one but Hugh knew how near she was; and he had only
learned it a few days before the battle, when he had, by
accident, a few moments’ conversation with Dr. Richards,
whom he had purposely avoided. He was talking of Adah,
and the practicability of sending for her, when she arrived
at the private boarding-house to which he had been removed.</p>

<p class='c011'>The particulars of that interview between the mother
and her daughter we cannot describe, as no one witnessed
it save God; but Adah’s face was radiant with happiness
and her eyes beaming with joy when it was ended, and
she went next to where Hugh was waiting for her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Hugh, my noble brother!” was all she could say,
as she wound her arms around his neck and pressed her
cheek against his own, forgetting, in those moments of
perfect bliss, all the sorrow, and anguish of the past.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>Nor was it until Hugh said to her, “The doctor was in
that battle, did he escape unharmed?” that a shadow
dimmed the sunshine flooding her pathway that autumn
morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the mention of <em>him</em>, the muscles about her mouth
grew rigid, and a look of pain flitted across her face
showing that there was yet much of bitterness mingled in
her cup of joy. Composing herself as soon as possible
she told Hugh that she was a widow, but uttered no word
of complaint against the dead, and Hugh, knowing that
she could not sorrow as other women have sorrowed over
the loved ones slain in battle, drew her nearer to him, and
kissing her tenderly, said, “Your home shall be with me
and Golden Hair—who has promised to be my wife.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he asked what Major Stanley’s plan was concerning
the body of her husband, and upon learning that it
was to bury the doctor at home, he announced his determination
to accompany them, as he knew he should be
able to do so.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a great trial to Adah to face the crowd they
found assembled at the depot, but Irving, Hugh, and
Alice all helped to screen her from observation, and almost
before she was aware of it she found herself safe in
the carriage, which effectually hid her from view. Slowly
the procession moved through the village, the foot
passengers keeping time to the muffled drum, whose solemn
beats had never till that morning been heard in the
quiet streets. The wide gate which led into the grounds
of Terrace Hill was opened wide, and the black hearse
passed in, followed by the other carriages, which wound
round the hill and up to the huge building where badges
of mourning were hung out for the only son, the youngest
born, the once pride and pet of the stately woman
who watched the coming of that group with tear-dim
eyes, holding upon her lap the little boy whose father
they were bringing in, dead, coffined for the grave. Not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>for the world would that high-bred woman have been
guilty of an impropriety, and so she sat in her own room,
while Charlie Millbrook met the bearers in the hall and
told them where to deposit their burden.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the same room where we first saw him on the night
of his return from Europe they left him, and went their
way, while to Dixon and Pamelia was accorded the honor
of first welcoming Adah, whom they treated with as much
deference as if she had never been with them in any capacity
save that of mistress. She had changed since
they last saw her—was wonderfully improved, they said
to each other as they left her at the door of the room,
where Mrs. Richards, with her two older daughters, was
waiting to receive her. But if the servants were struck
with the air of dignity and cultivation which Adah acquired
during her tour in Europe, how much more did
this same air impress the haughty ladies who had felt a
little uncertain as to <em>how</em> they should receive her. Any
doubts, however, which they had upon this subject were
dispelled the moment she entered the room, and they
saw at a glance that it was not the timid, shrinking Adah
Gordon with whom they had to deal, but a woman as wholly
self-possessed as themselves, and one with whose bearing
even their critical eyes would find no fault. She
would not suffer them to <em>patronize</em> her; they must treat
her fully as an equal or as nothing, and with a new-born
feeling of pride in her late son’s widow, Mrs. Richards
arose, and putting Willie from her lap, advanced to meet
her, cordially extending her hand, but uttering no word
of welcome. Adah took the hand, but her eyes never
sought the face of her lady mother. They were riveted
with a hungry, wistful, longing look on <em>Willie</em>, who, clinging
to his grandmother’s skirts, peered curiously at her,
holding back at first, when, unmindful of Asenath and
Eudora, who had not yet been greeted, she tried to take
him in her arms.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>“Oh, Willie, darling, don’t you know me! I am poor
mam-ma,” and Adah’s voice was choked with sobs at this
unlooked for reception from her child.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had been sent for from Anna’s home to meet his
mother, because it was proper; but no one at Terrace
Hill had said to him that the mamma for whom Anna
taught him daily to pray, was coming. <em>She</em> was not in
his mind; and as eighteen months had obliterated all
memories of the girlish creature he once knew as mother,
he could not immediately identify that mother with
the lady before him.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a sad disappointment to Adah, and without
knowing what she was doing, she sank down upon the
sofa, and involuntarily laying her head in Mrs. Richards
lap, cried bitterly, her tears bringing answering ones from
the eyes of all three of the ladies, for they half believed
her grief, in part, was for the lifeless form in the room below.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor child, you are tired and worn. It is hard to
lose him just as there was a prospect of perfect reconciliation
with us all,” Mrs. Richards said, softly smoothing
the brown tresses lying on her lap, and thinking even
then that <em>curls</em> were more becoming to her daughter-in-law
than braids had been, but wondering why, now she
was in mourning, Adah had persisted in wearing them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pretty girl, pretty <em>turls</em>, is you <em>tyin</em>?” and won by
her distress, Willie drew near, and laid his baby hand
upon the curls he thought so pretty.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s mamma, Willie,” Asenath said; “the mamma
Aunt Anna said would come some time—Willie’s mamma.
Can’t he kiss her?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The child could not resist the face which, lifting itself
up, looked eagerly at him, and he put up his little hands
for Adah to take him, returning the kisses she showered
upon him, and clinging to her neck, while he said,
“Is you mam-ma sure? I prays for mam-ma—God
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>take care of her, and pa-pa too. He’s dead. They
brought him back with a <em>dum</em>. Poor pa-pa, Willie
don’t want him dead;” and the little lip began to quiver.</p>

<p class='c011'>Never since she knew she was a widow had Adah felt
so vivid a sensation of something akin to affection for
the dead, as when her child mourned so plaintively for
papa; and the tears which now fell like rain were not
for Willie alone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mrs. Richards has not yet greeted us,” Asenath said;
and turning to her at once, Adah apologized for her
seeming neglect, pressing both her and Eudora’s hands
more cordially than she would have done a few moments
before.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where is Anna?” she asked; and Mrs. Richards
replied,</p>

<p class='c011'>“She’s sick. She regretted much that she could not
come up here to-day;” while Willie, standing in Adah’s
lap, with his chubby arm around her neck, chimed in,</p>

<p class='c011'>“You don’t know what we’ve dot. We’ve dot ’ittle
baby, we has.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Adah knew now why Anna was absent, and why Charlie
Millbrook looked so happy when at last he came in to
see her, delivering sundry messages from his Anna, who,
he said, could scarcely wait to see her <em>dear sister</em>. There
was something genuine in Charlie’s greeting, something
which made Adah feel as if she were indeed at home,
and she wondered much how even the Richards race could
ever have objected to him, as she watched his movements
and heard him talking with his stately mother.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Major Stanley came,” he said, in reply to her
question, and Adah was glad it was put to <em>him</em>, for the
blushes dyed her cheek at once, and she bent over Willie
to hide them, while Charlie continued, “Captain Worthington
came, too. He was in the same battle with the
doctor, was wounded rather seriously, and has been discharged,
I believe.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>“Oh,” and Mrs. Richards seemed quite interested,
asking where the young men were, and appearing disappointed
when told that, after waiting a few moments in
hopes of seeing the ladies, they had returned to the hotel,
where Mrs. Worthington and Alice were stopping.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I fully expected the ladies here; pray, send for them
at once,” she said, but Adah interposed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Her mother would not willingly be separated from
Hugh, and as he of course would remain at the hotel, it
would be useless to think of persuading Mrs. Worthington
to come to Terrace Hill.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But Miss Johnson surely will come,” persisted Mrs.
Richards.</p>

<p class='c011'>Adah could not explain then that Alice was less likely
to leave Hugh than her mother, but she said, “Miss
Johnson, will not leave mother alone,” and so the matter
was settled.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a terribly long day to Adah, and she was glad
when towards its close Alice was announced as being in
the reception room. She had driven round, to call on
Mrs. Richards, and after that take Adah with her to the
cottage, where Anna, she knew, was anxious to receive
her. At first Mrs. Richards demurred, fearing it would
be improper, but saying, “My late son’s wife is of course
her own mistress, and can do as she likes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Very adroitly Alice waived all objections, and bore Adah
off in triumph.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I knew you must be lonely up there,” she said, as they
drove slowly along, “and there can be no harm in visiting
one’s sick sister.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna surely did not think there was, as her warm,
welcoming kisses fully testified.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wanted so much to see you to-day,” she said, “that
I have worked myself into quite a fever; but knowing
mother as I do, I feared she might not sanction your coming;”
then proudly turning down the blanket, she disclosed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>the red-faced baby, who, just one week ago, had come
to the Riverside Cottage.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Isn’t he a beauty?” she asked, pressing her lips upon
the wrinkled forehead. “A boy, too, and looks so much
like Charlie, but—” and her soft, blue eyes seemed more
beautiful than ever with the maternal love shining from
them. “I shall not call him Charles, nor yet <em>John</em>, though
mother’s heart is set on the latter name. I can’t. I loved
my brother dearly, and never so much as now that he is
dead, but my baby-boy must not bear his name, and so I
have chosen <em>Hugh</em>, <em>Hugh Richards</em>. I know it will please
you both,” and she glanced archly at Alice, who blushingly
kissed the little boy named for her promised husband.</p>

<p class='c011'>They talked of Hugh awhile, and then Anna spoke of
Irving Stanley, expressing her fears that she could not see
him to thank him for his kindness and forbearance to her
erring brother.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He must be noble and good,” she said, then turning to
Adah, she continued. “You know him well. Do you like
him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” and Adah’s face was all ablaze, as the simple
answer dropped from her lips.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment Anna regarded her intently, then her
eyes were withdrawn and her white hand beat the counterpane
softly, but nothing more was said of Irving Stanley.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next day near the sun-setting, they buried the dead
soldier, Mrs. Richards and Adah standing side by side
as the body was lowered to its last resting place, the
older leaning upon the younger for support, and feeling as
she went back to her lonely home and heard the merry
laugh of little Willie in the hall that she was glad her son
had married the young girl, who, now that John was gone
forever, began to be very dear to her as his wife, the Lily
whom he had loved so much. In the dusky twilight of
that night when alone with Adah, she told her as much,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>speaking sadly of the past, which she regretted, and wishing
she had never objected to receiving the girl about
whom John wrote so lovingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Had I done differently he might have been living now,
and you have been spared much pain, but you’ll forgive
me. I’m an old woman. I am breaking fast, and soon
shall follow my boy, but while I live I wish for peace, and
you must love me, Lily, because I was his mother,” and the
hand of her who had conceded so much, rested entreatingly
upon the bowed head of the young girl beside her.
There was no acting there, Adah knew, and clasping the
trembling hand she involuntarily whispered,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will love you, my <em>mother</em>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And stay with me, too?” Mrs. Richards continued,
her voice choked with the sobs she could not repress, when
she heard herself called mother by the girl she had so
wronged. “Anna is gone, my other daughters are old. We
are lonely in this great house. We need somebody young
to cheer our solitude, and you will stay, as <em>mistress</em>, if
you choose, or as a petted youngest daughter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was an unlooked for trial to Adah. She had not
dreamed of living at Terrace Hill. But Adah had never
consulted her own happiness, and as she listened to the
pleading tones of the woman who surely had <em>some heart</em>,
some noble qualities, she felt that ’twas her duty to remain
there for a time at least, and so she replied at last,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I expected to live with my own mother, but for the
present my home shall be here with you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“God bless you, darling,” and the proud woman’s lips
touched the fair cheek, while the proud woman’s hand
smoothed again the soft short curls, pushing them back
from the white brow, as she murmured, “You are very
beautiful, my child, just as John said you were.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was hard for Adah to tell Mrs. Worthington that <em>she</em>
could not make one of the circle who would gather around
the home fireside, but she did at last, standing firmly by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>her decision, and saying in reply to her mother’s entreaties,
“It is my duty. They need me more than you, who have
both Hugh and Alice.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Adah was right, so Hugh said, and Alice, too, while
Irving Stanley said nothing. He must have found much
that was attractive about the little town of Snowdon, for
he lingered there long after there was not the least excuse
for staying. He did not go often to Terrace Hill, and
when he did, he never asked for Adah, but so long as he
could see her on Sundays when, with the Richards’ family,
she walked quietly up the aisle, her cheek flushing as she
passed him, and so long as he occasionally met her at Mrs.
Worthington’s rooms, or saw her riding in the Richards
carriage, so long was he content to stay. But there came
a time when he must go, and then he asked for Adah, and
in the presence of her mother-in-law invited her to go
with him to her husband’s grave. She went, taking Willie
with her, and there, with that fresh mound between them,
Irving Stanley told her what the dying soldier had said,
and asked if it should be so.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not now, not yet,” he continued, as Adah’s eyes were
bent upon that grave, “but by and by, will you do your
husband’s bidding and be my wife?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will,” and taking Willie’s hand Adah put it with hers
into the broad, warm palm which clasped them both, as
Irving whispered, “Your child shall be mine, and never
need to know that I am not his father.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was arranged that Alice should tell Mrs. Richards, as
Adah would have no concealments. Accordingly, Alice
asked a private interview with the lady, to whom she told
everything as she understood it. And Mrs. Richards,
though weeping bitterly, generously exonerated Adah
from all blame, commended her as having acted wisely,
and then added, with a flush of pride:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Many a woman would be glad to marry Irving Stanley,
and it gives me pleasure to know that to my son’s widow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>the honor is accorded. He is worthy to take John’s place,
and she, I believe, is worthy of him. I love her already
as my daughter, and shall look upon him as a son. You
say they are in the garden. Let them both come to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They came, and listened quietly, while Mrs. Richards
sanctioned their engagement, and then, with a little eulogy
upon her departed son, said to Adah, “You will wait a
year, of course. It will not be proper before.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Irving had hoped for only six months’ probation, but
Adah was satisfied with the year, and they went from
Mrs. Richards’ presence with the feeling that Providence
was indeed smiling upon their pathway, and flooding it
with sunshine.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next day Major Stanley left Snowdon, but not until
there had come to Hugh a letter, whose handwriting
made Mrs. Worthington turn pale, it brought back so
vividly the terror of the olden time. It was from Murdoch,
and it enclosed for Mrs. Worthington the sum of
five hundred dollars, “I have no reason for thinking you
rich,” he wrote, “and should she need more I will try to
send it as some atonement for the past.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, after speaking of his fruitless search for Adah,
and his hearing at last that she was found and Dr. Richards
dead, he added, “As there is nothing left for me to
do, and as I am sure to be playing mischief if idle, I have
joined the army, and am training a band of contrabands
to fight as soon as the government comes to its senses,
and is willing for the negroes to bear their part in the
battle.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The letter ended with saying that he should never come
out of the war alive, simply because it would last until
he was too old to live any longer.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a relief for Mrs. Worthington to hear from him,
and know that he probably would not trouble her again,
while Adah, whose memories of him were pleasanter, expressed
a strong desire to see him.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>“We will find him by and by, when you are mine,” Irving
said playfully and drawing her into an adjoining room,
where they could be alone, he said his parting words, and
then with Hugh went to meet the train which took him
away from Snowdon.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XL.<br> <span class='large'>CONCLUSION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The New England hills were tinged with that peculiar
purplish haze, so common to the Indian summer time, and
the warm sunlight of November fell softly upon Snowdon,
whose streets were full of eager, expectant people— all
hurrying on to the old brick church, and quickening their
steps with every stroke of the merry bell, pealing
so joyfully from the tall, dark tower. The Richards’
carriage was out, and waiting before the door of the Riverside
cottage, for the appearance of Anna, who was this
morning to venture out for a short time, leaving her
baby Hugh alone. Another, and handsomer carriage, was
standing before the hotel, where Hugh and his mother
were stopping, and where, in a pleasant private room, Adah
Richards helped Alice Johnson make her tasteful toilet,
smoothing lovingly the rich folds of greyish colored
silk, arranging the snowy cuffs and collar, and then bringing
the hat of brown Neapolitan, with its pretty
face trimmings of blue, and declaring it a shame to cover
up the curls of hair falling so luxuriously about the face
and neck of the blushing bride. For it was Alice’s wedding
day, and in the room adjoining, Hugh Worthington
stood, waiting impatiently the opening of the mysterious
door which Adah had shut against him, and wondering if,
after all, it were not a dream that the time was coming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>fast when neither bolts nor locks would have a right to
keep him from his wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>It seemed too great a joy to be true, and by way
of reassuring himself he had to look often at the crowds
of people hurrying by, and down upon old Sam, who, in
full dress, with white cotton gloves drawn awkwardly up
on his cramped distorted fingers, stood by the carriage,
bowing to all who passed, himself the very personification
of perfect bliss.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Massah Hugh the perfectest massah,” he said, “and
Miss Ellis a little more so;” adding that though “Canaan
was a mighty nice place, he ’sumed, he’d rather not go
thar jist yet, but live a leetle longer to see them ’joy
themselves. Thar they comes—dat’s Miss in grey. She
knows how’t orange posies and silks and satins is proper
for weddin’ nights; but she’s gwine travelin’, and dat’s
why she comed out in dat <em>stun-color</em>, Sam’ll be blamed if
he fancies.” And having thus explained Alice’s choice of
dress, the old negro held the carriage door himself, while
Hugh, handing in his mother, sister, and his bride, took
his seat beside them, and was driven to the church.</p>

<p class='c011'>Twenty minutes passed, and then the streets were filled
again; but now the people were going home, talking as
they went of the beauty of the bride, and of the splendid-looking
bridegroom, who looked so fondly at her as she
murmured her responses, kissing her first himself when
the ceremony was over, and letting his arm rest for a moment
around her slender form. No one doubted its being
a genuine love-match, and all rejoiced in the happiness
of the newly married pair, who, at the village depot
were waiting for the train which would take them on their
way to Kentucky, for that was their destination.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the distracted condition of the country Hugh’s presence
was needed there; for, taking advantage of his absence,
and the thousand rumors afloat touching the Proclamation
one of his negroes had already ran away in company
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>with some half-dozen of the Colonel’s, who, in a terrible
state of excitement, talked seriously of emigrating
to Canada. Hugh’s timely arrival, however, quieted him
somewhat, though he listened in sorrow, and almost with
tears, to Hugh’s plan of selling the Spring Bank farm and
removing with his negroes to some New England town,
where Alice, he knew, would be happier than she had
been in Kentucky. But a purchaser for Spring Bank was
not so easily found in those dark days; and so, doing
with his land the best he could, he called about him his
negroes, and giving to each his freedom, proposed that
they stay quietly where they were until Spring, when he
hoped to find them all employment on the farm he was
to buy in New England.</p>

<p class='c011'>Aunt Eunice who understood managing blacks better
than his mother or his inexperienced wife, was to be
his housekeeper in that new home of his, where the
Colonel and his family would always be welcome; and
having thus provided for those for whom it was his duty
to care, he returned to Snowdon in time to join the
Christmas party at Terrace Hill, where Irving Stanley was
a guest, and where, in spite of the war clouds darkening
our land, and in spite of the sad, haunting memories of
the dead, there was much of hilarity and joy—reminding
the villagers of the olden time when Terrace Hill was
filled with gay revelers. Anna Millbrook was there, more
beautiful than in her girlhood, and excessively fond of her
missionary Charlie, who she laughingly declared was perfectly
incorrigible on the subject of surplice and gown,
adding that as “the mountain would not go to Mahomet,
Mahomet must go to the mountain;” and so she was fast
becoming an out-and-out Presbyterian of the very bluest
stripe.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sweet Anna! None who looked into her truthful, loving
face, or knew the consistency of her daily life, could
doubt that whether Presbyterian or Episcopal in sentiment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>the heart was right and the feet were treading
the narrow path which leadeth unto life eternal.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a happy week spent at Terrace Hill; but one
heart ached to its very core when, at its close, Irving
Stanley went back to where duty called him, trusting
that the God who had succored him thus far, would shield
him from future harm, and keep him safely till the coming
autumn, when, with the first falling of the leaf, he
would gather to his embrace his darling beautiful Adah.</p>

<hr class='c014'>

<p class='c011'>On the white walls of a handsome country seat just
on the banks of the Connecticut, the light of the April
sunset falls, and the soft April wind kisses the fair cheek
and lifts the golden curls of the young mistress of Spring
Bank—for so, in memory of the olden time, Hugh and
Alice have named their new home. Arm in arm they
walk up and down the terraced garden, talking softly of
the way they have been led, and gratefully ascribing all
praise to Him who rules and overrules, but doeth nought
save good to those who love Him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Down in the meadow-land and at the rear of the building,
dusky forms are seen—the negroes, who have come
to their Northern home, and with them the runaway.
Ashamed of his desertion he has returned to his former
master, resenting the name of <em>contraband</em>, and denouncing
the ultra-abolitionist as humbugs, who deserved putting
in the front of every battle. Hugh knows it will be
hard accustoming these blacks to Northern usages but
as he has their good in view, he feels sure that in time
he will succeed, and cares but little for the opinion of
those who wonder what he “expects to do with that lazy
lot of niggers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>On a rustic seat, near a rear door, white-haired old
Sam is sitting, listening intently, while dusky Mug, reads
to him from the book of books, the one he prizes above
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>all else, stopping occasionally to expound, in his own
way, some point which he fancies may not be clear to
her, likening every good man to “Massah Hugh,” and
every bad one to the leader of the “Suddern Federacy,”
whose <em>horse</em> he declares he held once in “ole Virginny,”
telling Mug, in an aside, “how, if ’twant wicked, not
agin de scripter, he should most wish he’d put beech-nuts
under Massah Jeffres’ saddle, and so broke his fetch-ed
neck, ’fore he raise sich a muss, runnin’ calico so high
that Miss Ellis ’clar she couldn’t ’ford it, and axin’ fifteen
cents for a paltry spool of cotton.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In the stable-yard, Claib, his good-humored face all
aglow with pride, is exercising Rocket, who arches his
neck as proudly as of old, and dances mincingly around,
while Lulu leans over the gate, watching not so much
him as the individual who holds him. And now that it
grows darker, and the ripple of the river sounds more
like eventide, lights gleam from the pleasant parlor where
Mrs. Worthington and Aunt Eunice are sitting by the
cheerful fire, just kindled on the marble hearth. Thither
Hugh and Alice repair, while one by one the negroes come
quietly in, and kneeling side by side, follow with stammering
tongues, but honest hearts, their beloved master
as he says first the prayer our Saviour taught, and then
with words of thankful praise asks God to bless and
keep him and his in the days to come, even as he has
blessed and kept them in the days gone by.</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works.

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
